# **Week 1:** Introduction to R

#### ANTH 674: Research Design and Analysis in Anthropology
#### Professor Andrew Du

**NB:** A good portion of this tutorial is drawn from Gene Hunt's (Smithsonian Institution) R tutorials. 

## Introduction

Welcome to your first in-class R tutorial! 

![](https://ccawebfiles.blob.core.windows.net/images/happyCoder02.jpg){width="60%"}

From here on out, the first half of class will be me lecturing about a certain topic, and the second half will be devoted to you operationalizing what you learned using R (after all, the best way to learn statistics is to *do* statistics). 
In this way, topics are doubly reinforced (and triply so when homework is included), and you will hone your R skills.
Also, by using R in class, you can ask me whatever questions you'd like whenever you run into issues.

These days, R seems to be in the toolkit of every young researcher, so it is *very* important that you "master" R as much as you can, given a semester's time.
R is a language: it has a vocabulary and grammatical rules.
As with any language, the more you practice with R, the better you will be at it (e.g., practicing by going through a tutorial many, many times). 
And the better you are with R, the better you will be at analyzing and visualizing data. 

I know coding can be intimidating, so we will take it one step at a time. 
I like to think of coding as mini-puzzles that you solve with logic, using the syntax and rules of R (so it can be quite fun!).

So, let's get started! For your first tutorial, you will learn the basics of R.


## Goals for this tutorial

#### 1) Know what R is and what it can be used for.
#### 2) Get comfortable with R.
#### 3) Learn R's commands, syntax, and rules.


## What is R?

![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="15%"}

From the [R website](https://www.r-project.org): "R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics." 

R is an *extremely* powerful tool for analyzing data and producing publication-ready graphics.
Here is an example of the latter:

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K5Lrv.png)

R's power lies in its flexibility: if you can think up an analysis, you can execute it in R.
This means you can adapt analyses *to your research question* instead of having to adapt analyses to a statistical program's limited capabilities.
The trade-off is that you have to code all the steps in your analyses (no black box), but I view this as a positive: you have complete analytical control over what you're doing, and you are "forced" to really learn and understand what you're doing. 

If you become stumped while using  R, which will undoubtedly happen (it happens to me all the time), you can always Google and troubleshoot your issue.
Google and R make for a very powerful combination.
Once you figure out the issue, it becomes part of your R knowledge base, and you can then move onto figuring out more complex issues.
This is how you become a better R coder.


## The R console

Though you will be learning R directly through this interactive tutorial and not in R itself, the concepts are exactly the same. 
You will learn how to interact with R through your homework assignments. 

When you open R, you will encounter a blinking cursor in what is known as the **console**. The space below where you will enter code is equivalent to the R console. 

The console is where you carry out calculations, run tests, manipulate data, etc. 
Let's try a simple exercise: type `1` into the console and press CTRL and Enter (for Mac users, this will be the Apple key and Enter). 
In an actual R console, you would just press Enter. 
From here on, when I say "Enter", I mean CTRL and Enter.

```{r number, exercise = TRUE}
```

R spits back the number `1`, acknowledging that you've entered it in.

## The R console as a calculator

R also serves as a calculator, and I use it all the time for such purposes. 
Enter in `2 + 2` (spaces do not matter here and are a matter of personal preference) and press Enter. 
What do you think you'll get in return?

```{r addition, exercise = TRUE}
```

R can carry out all your standard arithmetic operators. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
arith <- data.frame(symb = c("+", 
                             "-", 
                             "*", 
                             "/", 
                             "^"), def = c("addition", 
                                           "subtraction", 
                                           "multiplication", 
                                           "division", 
                                           "exponent"))

kable(arith, col.names = c("R symbol", "Arithmetic operator"))
```

Note that R follows order of operations (PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplicaitons and division, addition and subtraction).
Play around with the different arithmetic operators below.
For example, what do you think you'll get when you enter in `(2 + 2) ^ 2 / 4`?

```{r pemdas, exercise = TRUE}
```

When in doubt, always use parentheses (e.g., `((2 + 2) ^ 2) / 4`).


## Objects and assignment operators

When you type numbers and do arithmetic in the console, R will return the correct answer, but the answer is not saved (it gets lost to the R "void").
To save numbers to be analyzed later, we need to use an **assignment operator**: `<-` or `=`.
For example, if I type in `x <- 8`, that `8` is now saved and can be brought up again later.
Try typing `x <- 8` below (`x = 8` will also work).

```{r assign, exercise = TRUE}
```

Note that nothing happened!
This is because you assigned `8` to `x`, which is called an **R object**, instead of entering `8` into the R "void".
Now type `x` on the second line (you can press Enter only to get to the second line; also click away the drop-down menu that appears) and press Enter. 
What do you think will happen?
You see that R has remembered that you assigned `8` to `x`, which is now remembered by R until you overwrite it with another number.

What do you think will happen when you type `x / 2` on the next line?

Note that names in R are *case-sensitive*. 
See what happens when you type in upper-case `X`.
It says "object 'X' not found" because you haven't assigned anything to `X`.

## Different types of variables

In addition to numbers, R recognizes and uses different types of variables.
These are summarized in the table below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
variables <- data.frame(Mode = c("numeric",
                                 "character",
                                 "logical",
                                 "factor"), Example = c("5, 2.3", 
                                                        "\"tooth\", \"Andrew\"",
                                                        "TRUE, FALSE",
                                                        "{explained later}"))
                                 
kable(variables)
```

The significance of these different types of variables might not be apparent now, but they will be later.
Let's play around with them anyway.
Enter `y <- "tooth"`, then enter `y` into the console. 

```{r logical, exercise = TRUE}
```

Now enter `z <- TRUE`, and then enter `z`.

**NB:** Each one of these standalone R consoles in the tutorial exists in its own universe. 
That is, the object `x` which we defined as `8` earlier, will not be "remembered" in this console.
Try entering in `x` and see what happens.
In an actual R console, `x` will be remembered as `8` until you overwrite `x`.


## Exercise 1: object assignment

1. Create a variable, `x`, and assign it a value of `10`.
Create a new variable, `xx`, that is equal to one-half of `x`, raised to the 2nd power. 
What do you get when you enter `xx` on the next line?

2. Create a variable, `y`, and assign it a value of `TRUE` (make sure `TRUE` is written in all caps!). Then assign `y` a value of `"a"`. 
What do you get when you enter `y` on the next line?

```{r exer1, exercise = TRUE}
# You can click the "Solution" button for the answers when you're done.
```

```{r exer1-solution}
# xx is 25.
# y is "a".
```


## Functions (and R help documentation)

A function takes information (i.e., **arguments**), does something with it, and returns a result. 
For example, `sqrt()` is a built-in R function that calculates the square root of a number (functions always have open and closed parentheses that surround the arguments). 
The `sqrt()` function has only one argument: the number that we want the square root of. 
Thus, if we wanted to find the square root of `25`, we would enter `sqrt(25)`. 
Try it out, or another number, below (ignore the drop-down menu for now; what that is will become clear soon).

```{r sqrt, exercise = TRUE}
```

Other functions have multiple arguments. 
To see what the arguments are, we can look at R's built-in help documentation. 
If you know the name of the function, you can use `?`. 
Otherwise, use `??` followed by some general keyword (if multiple keywords are involved, you have to surround them with quotation marks, so R recognizes that the words comprise one phrase).

`seq()` is a common function used to generate a regular sequence of numbers.
To see what the arguments for `seq()` are, we can look at the help documentation using `?seq`.
Try it out below.

```{r seq, exercise = TRUE}
```

### R's help documentation

You can see that the help documentation appears through your web browser.
All help files for functions consist of eight parts:

1. **Description:** There is a general description of what the function does
2. **Usage:** How to type and use the function
3. **Arguments**: The arguments and what they are
4. **Details**: details of what the function does
5. **Value**: the values returned
6. **References**: published references the function used
7. **See Also**: related functions
8. **Examples**: examples of how to use the function and what they do

**NB:** Under "Examples", you'll see that some of the examples are followed by a `#` sign and some comment. 
In R, everything that follows `#` will not be run in R.
This is how you comment on code. 

For `seq()`, we see there are five arguments: `from`, `to`, `by`, `length.out`, and `along.with`. 
Read the descriptions of the arguments.
Let's say we wanted to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10. 
According to the `seq()` help file, we would enter `seq(from = 0, to = 10)`, where we type out the argument names and define them with `=` and a value (this is why some R users advocate using `<-` as the assignment operator, to prevent confusion with using `=` to define arguments; I think it's fine since arguments always exist inside the parentheses of functions, though I use `<-` for what it's worth).
Try this out in the console.
What does it return?

You don't have to specify the argument names if you enter in arguments in the same order as they're defined: `seq(0, 10)` returns the same sequence as `seq(from = 0, to = 10)`.
A shortcut for generating a sequence of numbers that increase/decrease by one is `:`.
That is, `0:10` is the same as `seq(0, 10)`.

What if we wanted to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10 that increase by 2? See the `seq()` help file to see if you can figure this out.
Try it out below (click the "Hint" button if you're stuck).

```{r seq_by, exercise = TRUE}
```

<div id = "seq_by-hint">
It's the third argument, which you can also specify with `by = `.
</div>

Now we can make sense of the drop-down menu that magically appears when you type in a function name: it's R telling you what the arguments are.
Sometimes the argument names are self-evident, but other times you will need to look at the help file.
After you use a function many, many times, you will know the arguments by heart.


## Arrays

**Arrays** are collections of multiple numbers, characters, etc., each of which is called an **element**.
All elements must be of the same type in an array (e.g., all numbers, all characters, all TRUE or FALSE).
One-dimensional arrays are called **vectors**, and two-dimensional arrays are called **matrices.**
Arrays can be as many dimensions as you want them to be, though vectors and matrices are most common.


## 1D arrays: vectors

The sequence of numbers you created with `seq()` is a vector.
You can also use the concatenate function, `c()`, to combine separate elements into a single vector.
For example, let's combine the numbers 1, 5, 10, 2 into a single vector and assign it to an object called `x`.
We would accomplish this with `x <- c(1, 5, 10, 2)`.
Try it below.

```{r concat, exercise = TRUE}
```

We can count the number of elements within a vector using the `length()` function.
Use this function to count how many elements are in `x`, i.e., `length(x)`.


## Subsetting elements from an array

If we wanted to subset out only some elements of an array, we use hard brackets: `[]`.
For example, if we wanted to subset out the first element of `x`, we enter `x[1]`.
`x[2:3]` returns the second and third element within `x`.

Create an object `x` defined as `c(1, 221, 100, 3)`.
Can you figure out how to subset out the 2nd and 4th element?

```{r subset, exercise = TRUE}
```

<div id = "subset-hint">
Use `c()`.
</div>

Note that R respects order.
See what happens when you enter `x[c(3, 4)]` versus `x[c(4, 3)]`.

### Removing elements from an array

We can also remove elements from an array using `-`.
For example, if we wanted to remove the first element of an array, we would enter `x[-1]`.
If we wanted to remove the 5th and 7th element, we would enter `x[-c(5, 7)]`.

Define `x` as `1:10`.
Can you figure out how to remove the last element of an array?

```{r del, exercise = TRUE}
```

<div id = "del-hint">
You need to use `length()`
</div>

**Remember:** parentheses are associated with functions, while hard brackets are associated with subsetting!


## 2D arrays: matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.
To create a matrix, we can use the `matrix()` function. 
`X <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)` returns a matrix with three rows and two columns, whose elements are the numbers 1 through 6.
Try it out below.

```{r matrix, exercise = TRUE}
```

To subset out elements from a matrix, we now need two numbers since we're working with two dimensions. 
The first number indicates the row number, and the second indicates the column number.
So, if we wanted to subset out the element in the first row and second column, we would enter `X[1, 2]`.
If we use one number only, we would subset out an entire row or column (the `,` is still used to denote whether you're referring to rows or columns).
For example, `X[1, ]` returns the entire first row, while `X[, 2]` returns the entire second column.
We can also delete entire rows and columns using `-` as before.
For example, `X[-1, ]` deletes the entire first row.
Try these out in the console.

Here are some useful functions for seeing how large your matrix is.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mat.df <- data.frame(func = c("nrow()",
                       "ncol()",
                       "dim()"), purp = c("number of rows",
                                          "number of columns",
                                          "dimensions = c(nrow, ncol)"))

kable(mat.df, col.names = c("Function name", "What it does"))
```

You can also use the `array()` function to create an array with however many dimensions you want.
`array(1:6)` returns a vector with numbers 1 through 6; it gives the same result as `1:6` or `seq(1, 6)`.
`array(1:6, dim = c(3, 2))` gives a 2D array with three row and two columns with elements 1 through 6 (i.e., it's identical to the matrix `X` as we defined it above).

**NB:** In general, there are multiple ways to achieve the same thing in R. 
As you're starting out, I would stick with familiarizing yourself with one of these ways first.


## Operations on arrays

Many operations and functions can be applied to single elements, vectors, and matrices.
Operations are usually done element-by-element.

For example, let's say we have a vector defined as `x <- 1:4`.
What do you think you will get if you enter `x + 5`?
What about `sqrt(x)`?
Test out your predictions below.

```{r oper, exercise = TRUE}
```


## Exercise 2: arrays (vectors and matrices)

Here are some important things to remember for the questions below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
exer.df <- data.frame(Action = c(
  "Combine elements into a vector",
  "Make a matrix using matrix()",
  "Make a matrix using array()",
  "Subset a vector",
  "Subset a matrix by row and column",
  "Subset a matrix by row only",
  "Subset a matrix by column only"), 
  
  Example = c(
    "c(10, 7, 33, 101, -1)",
    "matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)", 
    "array(1:4, dim = c(2, 2))",
    "y[3]  # 3rd element of vector y",
    "X[1, 4]  # 1st row, 4th column",
    "X[3, ]  # entire 3rd row", 
    "X[, 4]  # entire 4th column"
  ))

kable(exer.df)
```

1. Create a matrix, `XX`, with 3 rows and 4 columns from the numbers 1 through 12. Take the 3rd row of this matrix, and assign it to a new variable `y`.

2. Create a new vector called `z` that is the same size as `y`, with each element 10 times the corresponding value in `y`. 

3. What does the following command give you: `dim(XX)[2]`?
Reason it out first and then check your answer.

```{r exer2, exercise = TRUE}
# You can click the "Solution" button for the answers when you're done.
```

```{r exer2-solution}
# Question 1
XX <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
y <- XX[3, ]

# Question 2
z <- y * 10

# Question 3
4
```


## Dataframes

Dataframes are tables of information, where each column can be of a different variable type (e.g., numbers, characters).
When you import data into R, it will usually be in dataframe form.
Rows, columns, and elements are subsetted/removed in the same exact way as a 2D array (i.e., matrix).
Look at the previous topic for a reminder of how to do this.

For illustrative purposes, let's look at a dataframe that's built into R.
We can access built-in R datasets using the `data()` function.
We will look at the "Edgar Anderson's Iris" dataset, called `iris` in R.
To access this dataset, enter `data(iris)`, and the dataset will be automatically saved to an object called `iris`.
Try this out and take a look at the first five rows (do you remember how to do this?).

```{r iris, exercise = TRUE}
```

<div id = "iris-hint">
Try `1:5`.
</div>

Another quick way of looking at the first six rows of a dataframe (or matrix) is to use the `head()` function; `tail()` returns the last six rows.
Try out `head(iris)`.
This is what you should see:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(iris)

kable(head(iris))
```

You can immediately see that the first four columns are numbers, and the last one is comprised of names, indicating which species is being measured.
This illustrates that dataframes can have columns with different variable types, something arrays cannot do.

But, what in the world are those column names?
And for that matter, what in the world is this dataset?!
You can pull up a help file for built-in R datasets in the same way you pull up help files for built-in R functions.
Enter `?iris`.
You can see what the dataset is under "Description", and what the column variables are under "Format".
FYI, a sepal is the green, leaf-like part of a flower that encloses the petals.
It looks like this:

![](https://cdn.britannica.com/39/91239-004-44353E32/Diagram-flowering-plant.jpg)

You can also bring up column and row names using `colnames()` and `rownames()`, respectively.
Try it out below (I have already preloaded the `iris` dataset, so you don't need to reload it using `data()`).

```{r names-setup}
data(iris)
```

```{r names, exercise = TRUE}
```

The row names here are not very interesting, as they're just counting/indexing the specimens as you go from top to bottom.

The nice thing about dataframes is that you can access a column using the column name with `$`.
For example, lets say we wanted to subset out the `Sepal.Length` column only.
You can do this using `iris$Sepal.Length`.
Try this out (or another column name).
**NB:** You can only use `$` with dataframes and cannot use it with matrices.


## Exercise 3: dataframes

We're going to look at another built-in R dataset: `mtcars`.
Load it using the `data()` function, and pull up its help file to learn more about it.

1. Bring up the row and column names.
What are these?

2. How many rows and columns are there in this dataset?

3. `mean()` is a handy built-in R function to calculate the mean/average of a vector of numbers.
Use this function to calculate mean fuel efficiency (`mpg`) and mean car weight (`wt`, in thousands of pounds) across all car models.

4. How would you save to a different variable the following subsets of this dataframe: 
a) columns 1 and 2
b) columns 1 and 4
c) the first ten rows
d) the first ten rows and the first three columns.

5. Make a new vector called `RelPower`, which is equal to the horsepower of a car (`hp`), divided by its weight (`wt`). 

```{r exer3, exercise = TRUE}
# You can click the "Solution" button for the answers when you're done.
```

```{r exer3-solution}
1. rownames(mtcars); colnames(mtcars)
# Row names are the different car models, and column names are different design and performance variables (see mtcars help file for more details). 
2. nrow(mtcars); ncol(mtcars)
dim(mtcars) # brings up both rows and columns
3. mean(mtcars$mpg); mean(mtcars$wt)
4a. x <- mtcars[, 1:2]
4b. x <- mtcars[, c(1, 4)]
4c. x <- mtcars[1:10, ]
4d. x <- mtcars[1:10, 1:3]
5. RelPower <- mtcars$hp / mtcars$wt
```


## Testing relationships

R is great for testing relationships, e.g., whether values within a vector are greater than 5.
Not only might this be interesting in and of itself, but it's also very useful for subsetting data according to some criterion.

Let's start with a simple example.
Enter `x <- 8` and then `x > 5`.

```{r greater, exercise = TRUE}
```

You see that R returns `TRUE`, acknowledging that the object `x`, which is defined as `8`, is greater than 5. 

We can do the same thing with a vector, recalling that operations on a vector are done on an element-by-element basis. 
For example, let's define `x <- 1:10`.
Look at what happens when you enter `x > 5`.

R returns a vector of `TRUE`/`FALSE` statements, indicating which element is greater than 5.
A handy function to use in this case is `sum()`, which returns the sum of all elements in a vector.
When using `sum()` on a vector of logical `TRUE`/`FALSE` statements, `TRUE` is equal to one and `FALSE` is equal to zero.
Therefore, using `sum()` will count the number of `TRUE` in your vector.
Try out `sum(x > 5)`.

**NB:** `sum()` is not only applied to vectors with logical elements, but is also applied to vectors with numbers.
See what happens when you use `sum()` on `x <- 1:10`.

Below is a table of all the relationships you can test with R:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
relation.df <- data.frame(Symbol = c(
  ">, <", 
  ">=, <=",
  "==, !=",
  "&, |"), Relationship = c(
    "greater than, less than",
    "greater or equal to, less than or equal to",
    "equal, not equal",
    "AND, OR"
  ))

kable(relation.df)
```

`&` and `|` are used for testing compound relationships, i.e., two or more stated relationships.
`&` means an element has to satisfy *both* statements to produce a `TRUE`.
"OR" in logic means "and/or", so `|` means an element has to satisfy at least one statement to produce a `TRUE`. 

Define `x <- 1:10`.
What do you think you'll get when you enter `x > 3 & x < 8`?
What about `x > 3 | x < 8`?

```{r comp, exercise = TRUE}
```

Can you explain why all elements are `TRUE` when using the second compound statement?


## Subsetting using logical statements

As we've seen before, we can subset a vector using indices, e.g., `x[c(3, 5)]`.
More usefully, we can subset a vector using logical statements, where those elements equalling `TRUE` are the ones subsetted. 

For example, create a vector `x <- c(4, 8, 30, 52)`.
First, look at what happens when you enter `x > 10`.
What do you think you'll get when you enter `x[x > 10]`?

```{r log_sub, exercise = TRUE}
```

You can also use logical statements to subset a matrix.
Create a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns, where the elements are `1:12`.
Subset out those elements greater than or equal to 10.

```{r sub_mat, exercise = TRUE}
# Click the "Solution" button if you're stuck
```

```{r sub_mat-solution}
X <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
X[X >= 10]
```


## Exercise 4: subsetting

```{r, echo = FALSE}
relation.df <- data.frame(Symbol = c(
  ">, <", 
  ">=, <=",
  "==, !=",
  "&, |"), Relationship = c(
    "greater than, less than",
    "greater or equal to, less than or equal to",
    "equal, not equal",
    "AND, OR"
  ))

kable(relation.df)
```

Let's use the `mtcars` dataset again (I've already loaded it for you).

1. Using the `mean()` function, compute separately the mean fuel efficiency (`mpg`) of big cars (>3000 pounds) and small cars (<3000 pounds). 
Remember `wt` is in units of thousands of pounds.

2. Extract a vector of horsepower (`hp`) values for cars that are *both* small (`wt < 3`) *and* fuel-efficient (`mpg >= 25`).

3. Create a logical vector called `muscle` that is `TRUE` when a car has high horsepower (`hp > 200`). Recall that the function `rownames()` returns the row names for a matrix or dataframe. Use this function, along with your `muscle` vector, to return the model names of the powerful cars.

```{r exer4-setup}
data(mtcars)
```

```{r exer4, exercise = TRUE}
# You can click the "Solution" button for the answers when you're done.
```

```{r exer4-solution}
1. mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$wt > 3])
mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$wt < 3])
2. mtcars$hp[mtcars$wt < 3 & mtcars$mpg >= 25]
3. muscle <- mtcars$hp > 200
model_names <- rownames(mtcars)
model_names[muscle]
# You could've also just went straight to rownames(mtcars)[muscle]
```


## Conclusion

Congratulations, you just completed your first R tutorial in this class!

![](https://www.askideas.com/media/16/Funny-Celebration-With-Cat.jpg){width="375" height="400"}

R has a steep learning curve, so I know it was a lot to digest.
My advice is to go through this tutorial everyday until it becomes second nature to you.
The material herein serves as the foundation for all future tutorials, and this is typically the case as we progress week by week.
In other words, you will get the most out of any given week's tutorial by "mastering" the material from previous weeks.

So, don't give up, and if you have any questions, please email/ask me!
