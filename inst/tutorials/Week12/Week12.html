<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week, we finished learning about multivariate statistics, which is the study and analysis of multiple variables. We first learned about <strong>distance matrices</strong>, which are the foundation for most, if not all, multivariate methods. We learned how distance matrices play a key role in two new ordination methods: <strong>principal coordinates analysis</strong> and <strong>non-metric multidimensional scaling</strong>. We then learned how distance matrices can be analyzed using <strong>cluster analysis</strong> to produce <strong>dendrograms</strong>, an effective way to visualize how similar data points are in terms of their variables. I finally very briefly covered non-hierarchical clustering techniques (e.g., <em>K</em>-means clustering, discriminant analysis) and multivariate regression (e.g., redundancy analysis). In this tutorial, we will learn how to conduct all these analyses in R, and by doing so, better learn what the methods are doing “underneath the hood”.</p>

<p>My hope is that between the lecture and this tutorial, you will not only know what these methods are used for but also how they work (at least conceptually). As your textbook says (pgs. 427-428), many statistical programs (including R) automate these methods, such that many researchers do not know the assumptions and mechanics of these techniques. This can lead to abuse and misuse of these methods. While these multivariate methods are best learned through the framework of matrix algebra (something I don’t know very well), I have done my best to teach you these techniques conceptually. That is, I have taught you what these methods are used for, when to use them, what is going on “underneath the hood”, and how to interpret the output. After absorbing the lecture and tutorial material, you should have a solid enough foundation to carry out these methods for your own research, or at least have the knowledge base to learn more about these methods on your own.</p>

<h2>Distance matrices</h2>
<p><strong>Distance matrices</strong> are matrices that summarize how (dis)similar variables are when compared in a pairwise fashion. They have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rows and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> columns (i.e., a square matrix), where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of analyzed variables. The variable names are the row and column names, and the element at the intersection of one variable (row) and another (column) tells you what the calculated distance is for those two variables (much like interpreting a scatter plot matrix). The diagonals (see figure below) are always zero because those elements are comparing one variable with itself: the variables are identical, so the distance is zero. The off-diagonals are almost always greater than zero, with larger numbers indicating more dissimilar variables. The best way to learn about distance matrices is by example, so let’s do that below.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Gray squares and the diagonal elements, while red squares are the off-diagonal elements.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-euclidean-distance" class="section level3">
<h3>Euclidean distance</h3>
<p>Let’s calculate a distance matrix for the <code>iris</code> dataset. This is done using the <code>dist()</code> function, where the default calculated distance is the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong>. In R, the variables to be compared in the distance matrix are formatted as rows, so <code>dist(iris[, -5])</code> will generate a distance matrix comparing observations (e.g., individual plants) to each other. In this case, the more dissimilar two plants’ petal and sepal measurements, the larger the distance. If we wanted to create a distance matrix comparing each pair of petal and sepal measurements to each other, we would have to transpose the dataset first, using <code>t()</code>. This type of distance matrix will calculate the distance between each pair of petal/sepal variables according to how (dis)similar each variable’s measurements on all plants are.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Euclidean_distance_2d.svg/2560px-Euclidean_distance_2d.svg.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>Because the <code>iris</code> measurements are continuous, we can use Euclidean distances for our distance matrix. Enter <code>dist(iris[, -5])</code> below and compare it to <code>dist(t(iris[, -5]))</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s work with the first distance matrix, so save it to an object (e.g., <code>iris_euc</code>). I actually find distance matrices in R kind of annoying to work with. They should have a set number of rows and columns (which should be equal), but <code>dim()</code> does not work on them. <code>head()</code> returns only the first six elements of the matrix. I find it easier to visualize distance matrices by transforming them to a matrix class first, using <code>as.matrix()</code> (distance matrices are <code>dist</code> class in R). Let’s look at the first five plants in our distance matrix using <code>as.matrix(iris_euc)[1:5, 1:5]</code>. As you can see, the diagonals are all zero, and the matrix is symmetrical: the lower triangle matches the upper triangle. This makes sense as the distance for Plant 1 and 2 is the same as that for Plant 2 and 1.</p>
<p>Plants 1 and 2 have a Euclidean distance of 0.54. Let’s calculate the Euclidean distance of these two plants “by hand”, and see if we get 0.54. The formula for calculating the Euclidean distance between the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th observation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  d_{i, j} = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n}(y_{i,k} - y_{j,k})^2},
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y_{i,k}\)</span> is the measurement for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation and the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th variable, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of variables. In English, this is basically saying subtract one observation’s variables from the other, square the differences, sum them up, and take the square root. See if you can code the Euclidean distance for the first and second plant in <code>iris</code> (i.e., the first two rows). You can click the “Solution” button if you get stuck.</p>
<p>The value you get should be the same exact one in your distance matrix (<code>iris_euc[1]</code>). We could do this for every pairwise combination of plants in <code>iris</code>. Or we could just use <code>dist()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-other-distance-metrics" class="section level3">
<h3>Other distance metrics</h3>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, Euclidean distances are best for continuous variables. If at least one variable is not continuous, one has to choose a different distance metric. Some common ones are Jaccard and Sorensen for variables with binary outcomes (e.g., 0s and 1s), chi-square and Bray-Curtis for frequencies of categorical data, and Gower for mixed continuous and categorical data (see pg. 404 in your textbook for more distance metrics, though there are even more than that!).</p>
<p>Let’s calculate a chi-square distance matrix for the <code>HairEyeColor</code> dataset. This dataset is a contingency table of the number of individuals with a given hair and eye color, so the chi-square metric is appropriate here. First enter <code>haireye &lt;- margin.table(HairEyeColor, 1:2)</code> to add male and female frequencies together. Enter <code>haireye</code> and see what comes out.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="chi" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>To calculate a chi-square distance matrix on this contingency table, we’re going to use the <code>distance()</code> function in the <code>analogue</code> package. To do this, enter <code>distance(haireye, method = "chi.distance", dist = TRUE)</code>; the argument <code>dist = TRUE</code> returns a <code>dist</code> class object. This distance matrix is telling us how similar hair colors are to each other, in terms of the proportion of individuals in each eye color. What do you think you’ll get if you transpose the table first? Test your intuition by trying it out above.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-comparing-pca-distance-to-euclidean-distance-of-original-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing PCA distance to Euclidean distance of original variables</h3>
<p>We are now in a position to see how well the Euclidean distances between <code>iris</code> variables corresponds to the Euclidean distances between points in PCA space. First, create a PCA of the four <code>iris</code> variables, using <code>iris_pca &lt;- prcomp(iris[, -5])</code>. You can get out the Euclidean distances between each point in PCA space with <code>dist(iris_pca$x)</code>. Plot these distances against the Euclidean distances of the original variables from above (<code>iris_euc</code>). You can do this with <code>plot(iris_euc, dist(iris_pca$x))</code>. You can add a 1:1 line with <code>abline(0, 1)</code>, where 0 is the intercept and 1 is the slope. This plot is known as a <strong>Shepard diagram</strong>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="compar" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the Euclidean distances between plants in terms of their original variables are preserved <em>exactly</em> in PCA space. This illustrates how PCA is just a <strong>rigid rotation</strong> of the original data: PCA simply rotates the original data cloud so that the axes of greatest variation align with the PCs (making sure that the PCs are perpendicular and independent to each other). Euclidean distances will be identical only if all PCs are considered. If the data are scaled first, then PCA will preserve the Euclidean distance between the scaled versions of the variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-principal-coordinates-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Principal coordinates analysis</h2>
<p>I introduced ordination to you using PCA, which is sensible since it’s by far the most common ordination method used by anthropologists. As a reminder, the main goals of ordination are (from your lecture):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Distill multivariate data into fewer variables/dimensions for plotting or analytical purposes.</li>
<li>Maintain as best as possible the distances between the original observations.</li>
<li>Create new variables/axes, where the first one is fit through the axis of greatest variation in the multivariate data cloud, the second one is fit through the axis of greatest residual variation left over from the first axis, etc.</li>
<li>Create new variables/axes that are perpendicular and independent to each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>PCA does all this, as does <strong>principal coordinates analysis</strong> (PCoA), which is also known as <strong>metric multidimensional scaling</strong>. I like to think of PCoA as the generalized, “jack-of-all-trades” ordination method. That is, PCoA is an ordination method that carries out <strong>singular value decomposition</strong> (SVD) on <em>any</em> distance matrix in order to reduce the data into fewer important variables. So, PCA can be considered a specialized form of PCoA, which is done on a Euclidean distance matrix. Likewise, correspondence analysis (to be covered later) is a specialized form of PCoA done on a chi-square distance matrix.</p>
<p>PCoA is slightly different from PCA, however, in that it does SVD on a distance matrix, not the variance-covariance matrix of the variables. Analyzing the variance-covariance matrix, which quantifies how variables are correlated, is how PCA distills correlated variables into PCs. Instead, PCoA uses a distance matrix, which tells us how similar two observations are, to plot observations in PCoA space where closer points indicate that they are more similar in terms of their variables. This also means that PCoA does not distill variables into PCs and therefore does not compute loadings.</p>
<div id="section-comparing-pca-pcoa" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing PCA &amp; PCoA</h3>
<p>Let’s calculate a PCoA using a Euclidean distance matrix to illustrate that this is identical to PCA. We will analyze the <code>iris</code> dataset again. First fit a PCA (<code>iris_pca &lt;- prcomp(iris[, -5])</code>) and create a PCA scatter plot (<code>plot(iris_pca$x[, 1:2])</code>). You can color-code the points by species if you’d like.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pcoa" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>To fit a PCoA to a Euclidean distance matrix, we need to first generate the matrix. This can be done using code from the previous topic: <code>iris_euc &lt;- dist(iris[, -5])</code>. Now we use the function <code>cmdscale()</code> to carry out the PCoA analysis. This is done with <code>iris_pcoa &lt;- cmdscale(iris_euc, k = 2, eig = TRUE)</code>. <code>k = 2</code> tells us that we only want the first two axes (i.e., <strong>principal coordinates</strong>), and <code>eig = TRUE</code> tells R to return the eigenvalues. Go ahead and create the PCoA plot with <code>plot(iris_pcoa$points)</code>.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the axes in your PCoA might be flipped (my y-axis is flipped). Remember that the signs of PC or principal coordinate scores are arbitrary; what matters is that they’re internally consistent (see the <em>Eigenvectors</em> topic in the Week 11 tutorial). This happens because signs depend on an arbitrary decision made during SVD. To fix my flipped y-axis, I simply multiply all principal coordinate 2 scores by -1: <code>iris_pcoa$points[, 2] &lt;- -1 * iris_pcoa$points[, 2]</code>. Now the PCA and PCoA plots are identical. And because they’re identical, I know a Shepard diagram of the PCoA points will perfectly preserve the Euclidean distances in original <code>iris</code> variable space (you can confirm this if you’d like, but you have to first change the <code>cmdscale()</code> argument to <code>k = nrow(iris) - 1</code>, the maximum number of principal coordinates allowed with 150 data points).</p>
<p>My advice is if you want to do an ordination on continuous variables, use PCA over PCoA, since the former gives you loadings, which are very informative.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-pcoa-eigenvalues" class="section level3">
<h3>PCoA eigenvalues</h3>
<p>To get out percent variance explained by each principal coordinate, we need to get out the eigenvalues. This is done with <code>iris_pcoa$eig</code>. Divide each eigenvalue by the total and multiply by 100 to get percent variance explained by each principal coordinate. Try this out below (you can also create a scree plot if you want!).</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="perc_var" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>You might notice that the eigenvalues of PCA (<code>iris_pca$sdev ^ 2</code>) are not the same as those from PCoA. In fact, the PCoA eigenvalues are larger by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of observations) because it does SVD on a distance matrix, as opposed to a variance-covariance matrix. So to get the PCA eigenvalues, just divide the PCoA eigenvalues by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> (149 for the <code>iris</code> dataset). This difference in eigenvalues does not affect the calculation for percent variance explained, however.</p>
<p>For those who are curious what the eigenvectors are in PCoA, those are actually the PCoA scores themselves (i.e., <code>iris_pcoa$points</code>, or the coordinates of the points in PCoA space). This is different than PCA, where the eigenvectors are the loadings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-correspondence-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Correspondence analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Correspondence analysis</strong> (CA) is an ordination done on chi-square distance matrices (with one extra detail, which I’ll cover below). Thus, it is used to ordinate frequencies of categorical data (e.g., number of individuals within species across sites). We will learn CA by first performing PCoA on a chi-square distance matrix.</p>
<div id="section-pcoa-on-chi-square-distance-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3>PCoA on chi-square distance matrix</h3>
<p>The dataset we will analyze for this section is the <code>HairEyeColor</code> dataset from before. Again, combine males and females using <code>haireye &lt;- margin.table(HairEyeColor, 1:2)</code>. Calculate a chi-square distance matrix using the same code as before: <code>hair_chi &lt;- distance(haireye, method = "chi.distance", dist = TRUE)</code>. I used this object name because the table rows are hair color, so that’s the variable being compared in the distance matrix. Run the PCoA analysis with <code>hair_pcoa &lt;- cmdscale(hair_chi, k = nrow(haireye) - 1, eig = TRUE)</code>. We are now extracting three principal coordinates with <code>k = nrow(haireye) - 1</code>, the maximum allowed given that there are only four rows (for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rows, you can only get <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> principal coordinates).</p>
<p>Create the PCoA plot. In lecture, I used <code>text()</code> instead of <code>points()</code> to add the hair color names to the plot. Look at the help file to see if you can figure out how to do it on your own (click the “Solution” button if you get stuck). You can also calculate percent variance explained by each principal coordinate (which I didn’t code) by analyzing the eigenvalues (like you did in the previous topic): <code>hair_pcoa$eig / sum(hair_pcoa$eig) * 100</code>.</p>

<p>Points that are closer are more similar in terms of proportion of individuals with certain eye colors. The PCoA plot is more interpretable if you can visualize those proportions. Do this using <code>mosaic(haireye, shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE)</code>. I discuss in more detail how to interpret a PCoA plot below, when we plot both hair and eye color on the same plot.</p>
<p>We could also create a PCoA plot of eye color by computing a chi-square distance matrix on the transposed version of our <code>haireye</code> table (so eye color is now on the rows). Try that out above (click the “Solution” button if you get stuck).</p>
<p>One of the nice things about doing PCoA on both hair and eye color is that we can plot both on the same PCoA plot (you could’ve plotted <code>iris</code> petal/sepal measurements on the PCoA plot from the previous topic). To do this, we first have to see if any of our axes are flipped (remember, this happens because of an arbitrary decision made during SVD). <strong>Only do this if you know how your two variables are related to each other</strong> (e.g., as discerned from a mosaic plot); CA, which I cover below, does this automatically. In my case, I know blond hair and blue eyes are strongly associated, so my x-axis is flipped. Again, I fix this with <code>eye_pcoa$points[, 1] &lt;- -1 * eye_pcoa$points[, 1]</code>. Now, I can place hair and eye color on the same plot. See if you can do this on your own (click the “Solution” button if you get stuck). You should get something that looks like the plot below.</p>
<p><img src="Week12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Now I will go over how to interpret the PCoA plot with both hair and eye color on it. We see that black hair and brown eyes are plotted together far from the origin (where the dashed lines intersect). In fact, one can imagine drawing an arrow from the origin to each of these points, and the arrows are pretty much parallel. The fact that the arrows are parallel and far from the origin means black hair and brown eyes are strongly positively associated with each other (as can be seen from the mosaic plot). You can interpret these imaginary arrows in the same way that you interpreted PC loadings from last week. This interpretation of black hair and brown eyes also applies to blond hair and blue eyes, which are plotted close together on the right side of the plot. Thus, black hair and brown eyes are on the opposite end of Principal Coordinate 1, which explains the most variation in the data, relative to blond hair and blue eyes. This means that if you have black hair, you’re unlikely to have blue eyes, and the same is true for blond hair and brown eyes. Using the same logic, we can see that red hair and green eyes are positively associated with each other. Lastly, how strongly associated hair and eye color are is a function of how close pairs of points are from the origin. So while brown hair and hazel eyes are plotted together, these points are close to the origin, so there is a weak positive association between the two.</p>

<h3>Correspondence analysis</h3>
<p>I introduced CA using PCoA because you are somewhat familiar with PCoA now and also to emphasize how all these ordination methods are related. That is, CA is pretty much just PCoA done on a chi-square distance matrix. The one additional difference in CA is that it up-weights cells in the table with larger sample sizes. This helps ameliorate the effect of smaller sample sizes which have larger sampling errors and may be outliers. So a CA is <em>identical</em> to a weighted PCoA.</p>
<p>A weighted PCoA is done in R using the <code>wcmdscale()</code> function in the <code>vegan</code> package. Let’s do this on a new dataset, <code>mite</code>, which has more data points, so you can see how a weighted PCoA is identical to CA. Load the <code>mite</code> dataset using <code>data("mite")</code> (it’s from the <code>vegan</code> package), and look at the help file for details about this dataset. First, create a chi-square distance matrix of the dataset using <code>mite_chi &lt;- distance(mite, method = "chi.distance", dist = TRUE)</code>. Soil cores (think of them like sites) are rows, so this is what is being compared. Soil cores with smaller distances will be more similar in terms of their species composition and abundances. Now run the weighted PCoA on the distance matrix with <code>mite_wpcoa &lt;- wcmdscale(mite_chi, k = nrow(mite) - 1, eig = TRUE, w = rowSums(mite) / sum(mite))</code>, where the <code>w = rowSums(mite) / sum(mite)</code> argument tells us to weigh soil cores by the abundance of mite individuals in each core relative to the number of all mite individuals in the dataset. Now create the plot of soil cores with <code>plot(mite_wpcoa$points[, 1:2])</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="wcmd" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can also just do CA directly using the <code>ca()</code> function in the <code>ca</code> package. Enter <code>mite_ca &lt;- ca(mite)</code> and then <code>plot(mite_ca)</code>. You can see that both soil core (blue circles) and mite species (red triangles) are automatically plotted, and percent variance explained is automatically calculated and added to the plot. To get out the eigenvalues yourself, enter <code>mite_ca$sv ^ 2</code>.</p>
<p>You can also see that the array of soil core points from the weighted PCoA is identical to that from the CA (though my y-axis in weighted PCoA is flipped). Moreover, the eigenvalues are identical (compare <code>mite_wpcoa$eig</code> and <code>mite_ca$sv ^ 2</code>). Again, a CA is identical to a weighted PCoA!</p>
<p>Lastly, let’s create a Shepard diagram with <code>plot(mite_chi, dist(mite_wpcoa$points))</code>. As you can see, an ordination done on a chi-square distance matrix <em>perfectly</em> preserves the original distances in the matrix!</p>
<p>My advice is that if you want to ordinate frequencies of categorical data, just do CA over a weighted PCoA. The former will automatically align both variables for you instead of having to do it manually (like we did for hair and eye color).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in more details about what CA is doing underneath the hood, including calculating the chi-square distance matrix “by hand” and doing SVD on it, <a href="https://www.displayr.com/math-correspondence-analysis/">this website</a> does a really good job explaining all those details.</p>

<div id="section-non-metric-multidimensional-scaling" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-metric multidimensional scaling</h2>
<p>Most ordination techniques do a rigid rotation of multivariate data and create many new axes fit to the axes of greatest variation in the dataset. The downside to this is that you can only ever plot two or three axes at a time, so you’re only getting a partial picture of the multivariate dataset (albeit an accurate one if the first two axes explain most of the variation in the dataset).</p>
<p><strong>Non-metric multidimensional scaling</strong> (NMDS), on the other hand, will take a multivariate dataset and “squish” it into two or three dimensions. It does this by leveraging computing power to try many different layouts of points in, for example, two-dimensional space until the Euclidean distances between points best correspond with the distances in the original distance matrix. Because of the computing power involved, NMDS is a relatively new ordination technique. Also, because NMDS uses this iteration technique, it does not perform SVD on a distance matrix, so the axes are not fit through the axes of greatest variation and there is no percent variance explained by the axes. How the points are related to axes in NMDS is completely arbitrary; all that matters is how close points are to each other. Lastly, like with PCoA, NMDS can be done on <em>any</em> distance matrix.</p>
<p>To do an NMDS in R, we will use the <code>isoMDS()</code> function from the <code>MASS</code> package. We will use our <code>haireye</code> dataset from before (<code>haireye &lt;- margin.table(HairEyeColor, 1:2)</code>). Enter <code>nmds &lt;- isoMDS(hair_chi, k = 2)</code>, where <code>hair_chi</code> is our chi-square distance matrix (i.e., <code>hair_chi &lt;- distance(haireye, method = "chi.distance", dist = TRUE)</code>) and <code>k = 2</code> means we want NMDS to squish our multivariate data into two dimensions. Enter <code>plot(nmds$points)</code> to plot the data. Use <code>text()</code> to add hair color labels to the plot.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="nmds" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>As you can see, black hair is far away from brown, as to be expected given how different their proportion of eye colors are (again, enter <code>mosaic(haireye, shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE)</code> to visualize this). Black and red hair are each close to brown hair because these pairs of hair colors have the most similar proportion of eye colors.</p>
<p><code>nmds$stress</code> gives us a measure of <strong>stress</strong>, which is how much the Euclidean distances between points in NMDS space <em>don’t</em> correspond with the chi-square distances in the original distance matrix. Stress is what is minimized during the NMDS iteration process. <code>isoMDS()</code> returns stress as a percentage, though its typically reported as a proportion, so divide stress by 100. A lower stress is preferred, where any number below 0.2 is acceptable (rule of thumb). The stress of our NMDS analysis is pretty much zero indicating that there’s a new perfect correlation between the Euclidean distances of NMDS points and the chi-square distances. We can see this with a Shepard plot: <code>plot(hair_chi, dist(nmds$points))</code>. The reason the Shepard plot here is so good is because <code>isoMDS()</code> automatically uses a PCoA on the distance matrix to get the starting configuration for NMDS (i.e., NMDS starts with the location of points from a PCoA and then continually adjusts them until stress is minimized). So this NMDS looks exactly like your earlier PCoA plot because that’s the optimal configuration! For your lecture, I chose a random starting configuration, hence why the scatter plot and Shepard diagram looks different.</p>
<p>As with PCoA, you could also plot an NMDS for eye color, but you cannot add those points to the hair color plot. Again, that’s because the points are arbitrarily aligned with the axes, so it’s difficult to get hair and eye color points aligned in the same direction.</p>

<div id="section-cluster-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Cluster analysis</h2>
<p>Recall that ordination visualizes multivariate data in a reduced dimensional space. Points that are closer in this space are more similar in terms of their variables. <strong>Cluster analysis</strong>, on the other hand, visualizes similarities between observations by joining similar data points into clusters. The most popular clustering methods are hierarchical, where more similar data points are united in smaller clusters, and the next most similar data points are then added to those smaller clusters to form larger clusters. This is visualized using a <strong>dendrogram</strong>. As with PCoA and NMDS, cluster analysis can be done using <em>any</em> distance matrix.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of clustering algorithms: <strong>agglomerative clustering</strong> and <strong>divisive clustering</strong>. The former starts with separate observations as individual clusters and successively joins them based on the similarities of their variables, while the latter starts with one large cluster of all observations and splits the data into smaller clusters until each observation is its own cluster. Agglomerative clustering is more popular than divisive clustering.</p>

<div id="section-agglomerative-clustering" class="section level3">
<h3>Agglomerative clustering</h3>
<p>Let’s perform agglomerative clustering on our <code>haireye</code> table from before (<code>haireye &lt;- margin.table(HairEyeColor, 1:2)</code>). Create the chi-square distance matrix using <code>hair_chi &lt;- distance(haireye, method = "chi-distance", dist = TRUE)</code>. To do agglomerative clustering in R, we use the <code>hclust()</code> function. Enter <code>hair_agg_clust &lt;- hclust(hair_chi, method = "average")</code>. The <code>method = "average"</code> argument means we’re using the <strong>UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean)</strong> algorithm, which is the most common in anthropology. Enter <code>plot(hair_agg_clust)</code> to see the dendrogram.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="agglom" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can make our dendrogram more visually appealing. First, we can make the y-axis label more accurate by labeling it as “Chi-square distance” (do this using the traditional <code>ylab =</code> argument). I also like setting argument <code>hang = -1</code>. This places the labels on the same level at y = 0.</p>
<p>Based on the resulting dendrogram, we can see that red- and brown-haired individuals are most similar in terms of the eye color proportions in each. The next most similar to these two is black hair, while blond hair is the most different from the other three. This confirms what we saw in our earlier ordination plots.</p>
<p>To interpret the y-axis (“Chi-square distance”), let’s look at the distance associated with where “Brown” and “Red” are joined (<code>hair_agg_clust$height[1]</code>). Note that this is the exact same chi-square distance separating brown and red hair in our distance matrix (enter <code>hair_chi</code>). So the y-axis tells us the chi-square distance between individual data points and between individual data points and clusters.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-divisive-clustering" class="section level3">
<h3>Divisive clustering</h3>
<p>This is done using the <code>diana()</code> function from the <code>cluster</code> package. Enter <code>hair_div_clust &lt;- diana(hair_chi)</code>. Then enter <code>plot(hair_div_clust, hang = -1, ylab = "Chi-square distance")</code>. This code returns two plots; if we only want the second plot with the dendrogram, add <code>which.plots = 2</code> to the <code>plot()</code> function.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="div" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>This dendrogram is very similar to the one produced by agglomerative clustering. There are some subtle differences with the chi-square distance at which higher clusters are joined. This is due to differences between the agglomerative and divisive clustering algorithms in terms of how higher clusters should be joined. The largest difference is that blond hair is on the right side of the plot in the divisive clustering dendrogram. This difference is purely aesthetic, however, as dendrograms can be thought of as mobiles: you can rotate clusters around the stem, and the results are identical.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This week’s lecture and tutorial concluded your education on multivariate methods. This week, we learned about new ordination methods, such as PCoA, CA, and NMDS. We also learned about cluster analysis, another multivariate exploratory method used to visualize which data points are more similar based on their variables. I didn’t really cover <em>K</em>-means clustering, discriminant analysis, or redundancy analysis in this tutorial and only provided you with the R functions for running these analyses.</p>
<p>What I want to emphasize, and what has been the dominant theme of my class, is how similar and unified all these different methods are. For ordination, the unifying method is PCoA, of which PCA and CA are specialized versions. That is, PCA can be thought of as a PCoA done on a Euclidean distance matrix, and CA can be thought of as a PCoA done on a chi-square distance matrix. NMDS is the outlier ordination method, as it doesn’t use SVD and instead “brute force” searches for the optimal configuration of points in a reduced number of dimensions (e.g., two or three).</p>
<p>Ordination and cluster analysis are unified by the fact that they both analyze distance matrices. So these two methods analyze identical inputs but display the results in different fashions. Ordination plots multivariate data in a reduced dimensional space, with closer points reflecting observation with more similar variables. In this way, ordination can be thought of as displaying similarities between observations on a continuous scale. Cluster analysis, on the other hand, places data points in clusters, so it portrays similarities between observations in a discrete fashion. These two method are just different ways of visualizing distance matrices; whichever one is more appropriate is dicatated by your research question.</p>
So instead of approaching these methods individually and becoming overwhelmed, remember how they’re all unified and that’ll greatly simplify how much you have to learn/remember; this will in turn facilitate your comprehension of these methods. (Recall that I adopted the same strategy when teaching you linear models). By teaching you multivariate methods in this way, I have hopefully maximized your understanding of these techniques, which will enable you to use them in your own research.
