<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have learned only about models where there is one
dependent variable (DV) involved (i.e., univariate statistics). But many
times, we have multiple variables we want to model as the DV, or we’re
interested in the structure and visualization of our multivariate
dataset. These questions are addressed in the branch of statistics known
as <strong>multivariate statistics</strong>.</p>

<p>This tutorial will teach you multivariate statistics in two main
parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fitting and interpreting <strong>multivariate models</strong>, where
there is more than one DV and one categorical independent variable
(IV).</li>
<li>Condensing multiple variables into fewer composite variables for
visualization purposes (i.e., <strong>ordination</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<p>I rarely see multivariate models in (biological) anthropology, but
ordination is <em>extremely</em> common, especially principal components
analysis. This tutorial will teach you how to execute these multivariate
methods in R, focusing on continuous variables only. By the end of this
tutorial, you should be able to conduct basic multivariate statistics
for your own research, if your research questions demand it.</p>

<h2>Multivariate models</h2>
<p>Multivariate models are those where more than one DV are modeled as a
function of one or more IVs. I will illustrate why we would want to do
this with an example. Imagine I’m interested in how skull morphology
varies across certain groups of humans. I’ve taken a bunch of linear
measurements, connecting osteometric points on each skull (see figure
below). Instead of testing each linear measurement separately as a
function of group, I can analyze all linear measurements together, which
is a true test of overall skull morphology as a function of group (it
also means less P-values calculated!). That is, fitting a multivariate
model instead of multiple univariate models asks a different research
question!</p>
<p><img
src="http://people.wku.edu/darlene.applegate/forensic/lab9/skullpts1.gif"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p>The main advantage of multivariate models is that they can account
for the correlation between DVs, which may reveal differences between
groups that are undetectable when using univariate methods to analyze
each DV separately. This tutorial will cover only those multivariate
models where multiple DVs are modeled as a function of one categorical
IV. Next week’s lecture and tutorial will briefly cover multivariate
models with a continuous IV.</p>
<div id="section-multivariate-normal-distributions"
class="section level3">
<h3>Multivariate normal distributions</h3>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> I didn’t really cover this topic in class, so
feel free to skim this section (it’s not necessary to complete the
exercises or HW).</p>
<p>Multivariate models assume that the dependent variables are
<strong>multivariate normally distributed</strong>. That is, each
variable is normally distributed and possibly correlated with each
other. Let’s illustrate this concept by simulating a multivariate normal
distribution, focusing on two variables for simplicity’s and
visualization’s sake (i.e., the bivariate normal distribution).</p>
<p>A bivariate normal distribution is an extension of the univariate
normal to two variables. Whereas the univariate normal distribution has
a single mean and SD (or its square: variance), the bivariate normal
distribution has a vector of two means (one for each variable) and a
<strong>variance-covariance matrix</strong>. The variance-covariance
matrix for a bivariate normal distribution is a 2x2 square matrix, where
each <strong>diagonal</strong> element is the variance for one of the
variable’s normal distributions (these two numbers can be different),
and the <strong>off-diagonal</strong> elements are the
<strong>covariance</strong> between the two variables (the off-diagonal
elements must be the same). The covariance is basically an
unstandardized correlation (a correlation is standardized to be between
-1 and 1).</p>
<div class="float">
<img

wwidth="40%"
alt="Gray squares are the diagonal elements, while red squares are the off-diagonal elements." />
<div class="figcaption">Gray squares are the diagonal elements, while
red squares are the off-diagonal elements.</div>
</div>
<p>I have provided code in the console below for simulating a bivariate
normal distribution. Each variable will have 100 data points, a mean of
1, and a variance of 2. The zeroes in the off-diagonals mean that the
two variables are uncorrelated. Go ahead and run the code (see what the
output <code>bivar_norm</code> is and why <code>plot(bivar_norm)</code>
works).</p>

</div>
<p>Try plotting histograms of each of the variables separately (they
should be normally distributed). Does the mean of each variable closely
match our prespecified number (i.e., 1)? What about the variance for
each variable? If you increase the diagonal elements, the variance of
each variable should increase (and vice versa). If the off-diagonals are
non-zero, the variables will be correlated (positive off-diagonals will
generate a positive correlation, while negative off-diagonals will
create negative correlations). Go ahead and try out different values for
the means, variances, and covariances.</p>
<p>In the next topic, we will conduct a Hotelling’s
<em>T</em><sup>2</sup> test on data simulated from a bivariate normal
distribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-hotellings-t2" class="section level2">
<h2>Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup></h2>
<p><strong>Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup></strong> models more than
one DV as a function of one categorical IV with two levels (i.e., the IV
is binomial). It is the multivariate extension of the t-test. Whereas
the t-test tests if two groups’ means are significantly different,
Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup> tests if two groups’ centroids are
significantly different. A <strong>centroid</strong> is a measure of
central tendency for more than one variable. It can be thought of as the
central tendency of a cloud of points in <em>n</em> dimensions, where
<em>n</em> is the number of variables involved. It is calculated simply
as the mean of each variable, which gives its coordinates.</p>
<p>I have simulated two DVs for you (using the code from the previous
topic), and they are saved as two columns in the matrix,
<code>bivar_norm</code>. Go ahead and calculate the centroid of the two
variables. You can create a scatter plot of the two DVs against each
other with <code>plot(bivar_norm)</code>, and then add the centroid to
the plot using <code>points()</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>Now let’s conduct a Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup> on the data in
the plot below. There are two groups (<code>grp</code>), each of which
has two DVs (<code>DV1</code>, <code>DV2</code>). The two groups are
represented by different colors, with centroids as solid points. The
data are found in the dataframe, <code>d</code>.</p>
<p><img src="Week12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>We use Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup> to assess whether the two
groups’ centroids are significantly different by modeling the two DVs as
a function of the binomial IV. First recall that an ANOVA done on two
groups (i.e., a binomial IV) is the same as a t-test. This also applies
to multivariate models, so we can use the <code>manova()</code> function
to conduct a Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup> test.
<code>manova()</code> uses formula notation, where the DV must be a
matrix, whose columns are the individual variables (can use
<code>as.matrix()</code> or <code>cbind()</code>). Wrap
<code>anova()</code> around the <code>manova()</code> function to get
the ANOVA table.</p>
<p>As you can see, the two groups’ centroids are significantly different
(the P-value of interest is the one associated with the categorical IV).
The test statistic used for calculating the P-value is Pillai’s trace,
which is fairly forgiving when it comes to the assumption of
multivariate normality.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-multivariate-analysis-of-variance-manova"
class="section level2">
<h2>Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)</h2>
<p>A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is the multivariate
extension of an ANOVA: it model multiple DVs as a function of one or
more categorical IVs. We will specifically look at a one-way MANOVA,
which models multiple DVs as a function of one categorical IV.</p>
<p>For this topic, we will analyze the example I looked at in class: we
have two DVs, which are student satisfaction (<code>Satisfaction</code>)
and test scores (<code>Test</code>), as a function of one categorical
IV, which is three different teaching methods (<code>Method</code>). The
data are found in the dataframe, <code>teach</code>, and are plotted
below (triangles represent centroids).</p>
<p><img src="Week12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>We will specifically analyze this dataset to see how multivariate
models can reveal differences between groups that are undetected using
multiple univariate models. This is because multivariate models
incorporate information on the relationships between DVs when
determining whether groups’ centroids are significantly different (the
same is true of Hotelling’s <em>T</em><sup>2</sup> vs. a t-test).</p>
<p>First, run two separate one-way ANOVAs, each testing whether student
satisfaction or test scores are significantly different across teaching
methods (you can create box plots to visualize the data).</p>

<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="man-solution"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"

<pre class="text"><code># box plots
boxplot(Satisfaction ~ Method, data = teach)
boxplot(Test ~ Method, data = teach)

# ANOVAs
anova(aov(Satisfaction ~ Method, data = teach))
anova(aov(Test ~ Method, data = teach))

# MANOVA
anova(manova(as.matrix(teach[, c(&quot;Test&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction&quot;)]) ~ teach$Method))
anova(manova(cbind(Test, Satisfaction) ~ Method, data = teach)) # also works</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, neither of the one-way ANOVAs are significant (though
this is likely due to small sample sizes, as <code>Test</code> looks
like it varies across <code>Method</code> according to a box plot).</p>
<p>Now use <code>manova()</code> to run a one-way MANOVA with the DVs
<code>Test</code> and <code>Satisfaction</code> as a function of
<code>Method</code>. Wrap <code>anova()</code> around
<code>manova()</code> to get the ANOVA table and P-value. We now have a
significant result! This result illustrates that MANOVAs have greater
statistical power and are able to detect smaller effects than individual
univariate ANOVAs. You can think of this as MANOVA incorporating and
leveraging more information (i.e., the correlation between DVs) than
ANOVAs. Indeed, you can see in the plot that the diagonal ellipse of
blue points is separate from the red and black points when the DVs are
plotted against each other in two dimensions. That is, blue has a larger
test score for a given satisfaction score when compared to red and
black.</p>

<div id="section-ordination" class="section level2">
<h2>Ordination</h2>
<p>Ordinations are most commonly used to explore and visualize a
multivariate dataset. The number of variables in one’s dataset dictates
the number of plot axes (e.g., visualizing
<code>iris$Petal.Length</code> and <code>iris$Petal.Width</code>
requires two plot axes). Therefore, it is impossible to plot more than
three variables in a single plot. Ordination allows us to get around
this problem by distilling multiple variables into a smaller number of
composite variables. It does this by collapsing correlated variables
into one (e.g., because <code>iris$Petal.Length</code> and
<code>iris$Petal.Width</code> are strongly correlated, they offer
redundant information and can be represented by one composite variable).
This is why ordinations are known as <strong>data reduction
methods</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1619/0*5Iaw94wlYCTp0GuK.png"
style="width:90.0%" /></p>
<p>Different types of ordinations are used depending on the data type of
one’s variables. I will introduce ordination using principal components
analysis, by far the most common ordination method, at least in
anthropology.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-principal-components-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Principal components analysis</h2>
<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is an ordination method, used
when all your variables are continuous. Conceptually, it creates
composite variables (i.e., <strong>principal components</strong> or PCs)
by first centering the data and then fitting a line through the axis of
greatest variation (<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/lNHqt.gif">see
animation here</a>; the specific line fitting method is called
<strong>major axis regression</strong>). It then rotates the plot so
this line (i.e., the first principal component or PC1) is now on the
x-axis. Subsequent PCs are fit so that they’re perpendicular to (and
thus independent of) previous PCs. These subsequent PCs can be thought
of as fitting the residual variation left over from previous PCs (this
is also why they always explain less variation than previous PCs). Each
PC represents a composite of the original variables, and this is how PCA
condenses one’s original variables into a few variables of interest
(i.e., PCs). Note that you can only have as many PCs as you do
variables, but it is usually the case that only the first several PCs
are important (importance based on amount of variance in data
explained).</p>
<p>Because PCA works by fitting PCs through axes of greatest variation,
variables with more variation will strongly influence how PCs are fit to
the data. This is fine when the variation in one’s multivariate dataset
is of interest itself, but this can be a problem when variables are more
variable just because, for example, they’re in different units.
Therefore, it is common practice to scale each variable before running a
PCA.</p>
<div id="section-doing-a-pca-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Doing a PCA in R</h3>
<p>This is done using the <code>prcomp()</code> function. We only need
to enter in one argument, which is the multivariate dataset, where each
variable is a column and each observation is a row. Note that
<code>prcomp()</code> will automatically center each variable for you.
Instead of scaling each variable yourself, <code>prcomp()</code> can do
it for you if you set the argument <code>scale = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s try fitting a PCA to the four measurements in the
<code>iris</code> dataset. Because all measurements are all in
centimeters and are of the same order of magnitude, scaling is not
necessary here.</p>

<p>You can get out the PCA <strong>scores</strong> (i.e., the
coordinates of each observation in PCA space) with
<code>iris.pca$x</code> (assuming you called your PCA results
<code>iris.pca</code>). Plot the scores of the first two axes in a
scatter plot. You can even color-code the points by species if you want!
Points that are closer in PCA space are more similar when it comes to
petal and sepal morphology (as determined by the four measurements in
<code>iris</code>).</p>
<p>To understand what each PC means and represents, we have to turn to
the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-eigenvalues" class="section level2">
<h2>Eigenvalues</h2>
<p>An <strong>eigenvalue</strong> is the amount of variance explained by
each PC. Therefore, you have as many eigenvalues as you do PCs. To get
out the eigenvalues from <code>iris.pca</code>, enter
<code>iris.pca$sdev</code>. Note that this code returns eigenvalues as
standard deviations. To get variances, simply square
<code>iris.pca$sdev</code>. Note that variance decreases as you progress
to higher PCs; this is always the case.</p>

</div>
<p>A common way to plot eigenvalues is to create a bar plot. This is
known as a <strong>scree plot</strong>, which mimics the profile of a
mountainside where rubble has fallen (i.e., a scree slope; see image
below).</p>
<p><img
src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Yamnuska_bottom_cliff.jpg/1024px-Yamnuska_bottom_cliff.jpg"
style="width:30.0%" /></p>
<p>Now we can get the percentage of variance in the multivariate dataset
explained by each PC. This is done by simply dividing each eigenvalue by
the sum of all eigenvalues and then multiplying this by 100. Do this in
the console above.</p>
<p>We can see that PC1 explains over 92% of the variation in the data,
and PC2 explains a measly 5%. Therefore, if I were to subsequently
analyze the PCs (e.g., for hypothesis testing), I would just analyze
PC1, which does more than a good job of capturing the variation in the
four <code>iris</code> variables.</p>
<p>To interpret what eigenvalues mean in the context of the original
variables, we can see that the sum of all eigenvalues equals the sum of
the variances of all your original variables (check this in the console
above). This demonstrates that the original variance in your dataset is
preserved in PCA and that all PCA is doing is rotating and reorienting
your original data.</p>
<div id="section-singular-value-decomposition" class="section level3">
<h3>Singular value decomposition</h3>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: This section goes into brief detail about what
PCA is actually doing underneath the hood. It is not necessary to know
for the exercises or HW.</p>
<p>I explained how PCA conceptually works above, but what it’s
<em>actually</em> doing underneath the hood is a <strong>singular value
decomposition</strong> (SVD) of the variance-covariance matrix of the
original variables. SVD will return the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
(covered in the next topic) from the variance-covariance matrix.</p>
<p>All this is easy to do in R. First, create the variance-covariance
matrix of the dataset by entering
<code>iris.vcov &lt;- cov(subset(iris, select = -Species))</code>. Then,
use the <code>svd()</code> function to do an SVD of the
variance-covariance matrix: <code>iris.svd &lt;- svd(iris.vcov)</code>.
<code>iris.svd$d</code> returns the eigenvalues from the SVD for each
PC. <code>iris.svd$u</code> returns the eigenvectors, from which one can
calculate PC scores (see next section).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-eigenvectors" class="section level2">
<h2>Eigenvectors</h2>
<p><strong>Eigenvectors</strong> tell us how each PC is related to the
original variables. Each PC has one eigenvector, and the elements within
each eigenvector are called <strong>loadings</strong> because they tell
us how each of the original variables “loads” on each PC. Loadings range
from -1 to 1, where the sign indicates the direction of the relationship
between the variable and PC, and the magnitude indicates how much each
variable contributes to the PC (also how tightly the two are
correlated). For example, a PC1 loading of 0.86 for
<code>iris$Petal.Length</code> tells us that as PC1 increases,
<code>Petal.Length</code> increases, and vice versa (i.e., the two are
positively correlated). 0.86 is a large value, indicating that
<code>Petal.Length</code> contributes a lot to and is strongly
correlated with PC1. On the other hand, a PC1 loading of -0.08 for
<code>Sepal.Width</code> indicates that as PC1 increases,
<code>Sepal.Width</code> decreases—but this relationship is noisy—and
<code>Sepal.Width</code> doesn’t contribute much to PC1.</p>
<p>To get out the loadings in R, enter <code>iris.pca$rotation</code>.
If you did SVD in the last topic, you can get out the loadings with
<code>iris.svd$u</code>. Note that some of the loading signs might be
switched between <code>iris.pca$rotation</code> and
<code>iris.svd$u</code>. The signs of the loadings are arbitrary and are
a function of how each PC is fit through the data. What is important are
the loading magnitudes and the fact that the directions of loadings for
each PC are internally consistent. For example,
<code>iris.pca$rotation</code> returns PC1 loadings that are positive
for <code>Sepal.Length</code>, <code>Petal.Length</code>, and
<code>Petal.Width</code> and negative for <code>Sepal.Width</code>. This
means that the first three variables are positively correlated with each
other (ignoring the strength of correlation for now) and are each
negatively correlated with <code>Sepal.Width</code>.
<code>iris.svd$u</code> returns PC1 loadings that are negative for
<code>Sepal.Length</code>, <code>Petal.Length</code>, and
<code>Petal.Width</code> and positive for <code>Sepal.Width</code>. As
with <code>iris.pca$rotation</code>, these results tell us
<code>Sepal.Length</code>, <code>Petal.Length</code>, and
<code>Petal.Width</code> are positively correlated with each other, and
each is negatively correlated with <code>Sepal.Width</code>.</p>

<p>One way to graphically portray loadings is as arrows on a PCA scatter
plot. This is easily done in R with the <code>biplot()</code> function,
where the only argument is the PCA results object (e.g.,
<code>biplot(iris.pca)</code>). Try it out above.</p>
<p>As you can see, for example, the arrow for <code>Petal.Length</code>
is long and pointing to the right in an almost horizontal fashion. This
means <code>Petal.Length</code> has a large (long arrow) and positive
loading for PC1 (pointing to the right along the PC1 axis). The arrow
for <code>Sepal.Length</code> is moderately long and points to the
bottom right. This means this variable has a moderate-magnitude loading
that is positive for PC1 (points to the right) and negative for PC2
(points downward). Compare the arrow patterns to the actual loadings to
get a feel for how the arrows graphically portray each variable’s
loading.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Transforming original data to PCA scores</h3>
<p>Eigenvectors also tell us how to transform data from the original
variable coordinate system to PCA space and back. Let’s see how this is
done with a specific example, i.e., Plant #1 from the <code>iris</code>
dataset. First, remove <code>Species</code> from <code>iris</code> and
then center each variable, using
<code>scale(iris1, scale = FALSE)</code> (R will apply
<code>scale()</code> to each column in the dataset). Next, subset out
the first row of your new dataset (this is Plant #1). To get out the PC1
score for Plant #1, we multiply each of Plant #1’s measurements by its
corresponding PC1 loading (according to variable), and then sum
everything. That is,
<code>sum(plant1 * iris.pca$rotation[, "PC1"])</code>. Compare the
result to <code>iris.pca$x[1, "PC1"]</code>; they should be the
same.</p>

# compare the two
sum(plant1 * iris.pca$rotation[, &quot;PC1&quot;])
iris.pca$x[1, 1]

# compare the two
iris.center %*% iris.pca$rotation
iris.pca$x</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This exercise emphasizes how PC loadings are also interpreted as how
much each variable contributes to a PC. That is, in this case, the PC1
score for Plant #1 is the sum of of its variables weighted by the PC1
loadings. The larger magnitude the loading, the more that variable
contributes to the final PC score. Conversely, if a loading is near
zero, it will essentially “negate” its corresponding variable (because
the resulting product will be near zero), thus contributing very little
to the final PC score.</p>
<p>One can also use matrix algebra to get the PC scores for all
observations and PCs. You do this by multiplying the matrix of centered
<code>iris</code> variables by the matrix of PCA loadings:
<code>iris.center %*% iris.pca$rotation</code> (see pgs. 525-526 in
Gotelli &amp; Ellison to learn how to multiply two matrices
together).</p>

<div id="section-hypothesis-testing-with-pca" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis testing with PCA</h2>
<p>PCA in itself is not used for hypothesis testing, but the resulting
PCA scores can be used for such purposes. For example, a PCA of the
<code>iris</code> variables shows that PC1 is strongly positively
correlated with <code>Petal.Length</code>, and more moderately
positively correlated with <code>Sepal.Length</code> and
<code>Petal.Width</code>; <code>Sepal.Width</code> does not really
contribute to PC1. Therefore, PC1 is a composite of mostly
<code>Petal.Length</code> and some <code>Sepal.Length</code> and
<code>Petal.Width</code>. We can use an ANOVA to test if this composite
variable is significant different across <code>iris$Species</code>. This
is done by fitting an ANOVA, where PC1 scores is the DV and
<code>Species</code> is the IV. Try this out below.</p>

significantly different across <code>Species</code>.</p>
<p>If one had a separately measured IV (e.g., nitrogen levels for each
plant), one could model PC1 scores as a function of that. One can also
distill collinear IVs using PCA: fit a PCA to the collinear variables
and use the PC1 scores as the new composite IV that represents the
previous IVs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This tutorial introduced you to multivariate statistics with
multivariate models and ordination. Many research questions require the
analysis of a multivariate DV (e.g., the human skull example in
<em>Multivariate models</em>). It is better to fit one’s analysis to the
research question instead of the other way around (the research question
always rules!). Sticking with our skull example, we should treat the
many linear measurements as a multivariate DV instead of analyzing them
separately as univariate DVs (the latter asks a different research
question). This is why it is important to have a fundamental
understanding of the many statistical methods out there, so you can pick
the one most appropriate for your research question.</p>
<p>Multivariate models are used to assess how a multivariate DV varies
as a function of one or more IV. This week, we focused only on those
multivariate models that have one categorical IV (i.e., Hotelling’s
<em>T</em><sup>2</sup> and one-way MANOVA). Next week, we will briefly
cover those multivariate models that have a continuous IV. As alluded to
in the previous paragraph, multivariate models ask a different research
question than multiple univariate models by jointly analyzing multiple
DVs together. This also has the advantage of incorporating more
information into the analysis (i.e., the correlations between DVs), with
the result that multivariate models are able to detect differences that
are missed with multiple univariate models (e.g., our teaching method
example).</p>
<p>Ordinations are used to condense multiple variables into a few
important ones. The main purpose of this is exploratory: ordination
allows one to plot many variables in two- or three-dimensional space,
while still accounting for most of the variation in one’s multivariate
dataset. We went over principal components analysis, by far the most
common ordination method, at least in anthropology. PCA is done only on
continuous variables. We learned what PCA is doing “underneath the
hood”, as well as what all the outputs are and how to interpret them
(i.e., scores, eigenvalues, eigenvectors/loadings). PCA can be used for
hypothesis testing by treating PC scores as composites of the original
variables, which can then be entered as a DV or IV in other models (you
can understand how the original variables contribute to each PC using
the loadings).</p>
<p>This week’s lecture and tutorial provided you with the basic skillset
and know-how for conducting multivariate analyses in R. The hope is that
you are now able to carry out multivariate statistics for your own
research if your research question requires it.
