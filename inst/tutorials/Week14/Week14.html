<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week, we covered what can be considered the fundamentals of
statistics (i.e., probability theory) and model-building (i.e.,
probability theory, likelihood, and the Bayesian paradigm).</p>
<p><strong>Probability theory</strong> lies at the foundation of
statistical inference, which includes computing P-values and confidence
intervals. One can also create mathematical models using probability
theory itself.</p>
<p><strong>Likelihood</strong> is a principled frequentist framework for
parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and model selection. In fact,
many, if not all, frequentist tests can be derived using likelihood
(e.g., t-tests, ordinary least squares regression), so likelihood
represents a unified framework for all frequentist models.</p>
<p><strong>Bayesian methods</strong> combine prior information with a
likelihood function to get a posterior probability of some quantity of
interest, given the data. One advantage (or disadvantage depending on
whom you ask) of Bayesian methods is how probability is interpreted.
This interpretation is known as <strong>subjective probability</strong>,
and it quantifies one’s <em>uncertainty</em> or <em>degree of
belief</em> in some event. This interpretation is different than the
frequentist one, which interprets probabilities as the long-run relative
frequency of some event happening.</p>

style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>I view these three topics as hierarchical, where likelihood depends
on probability theory and Bayesian methods depend on likelihood. More
specifically, probability distributions lie at the heart of likelihood
methods, and Bayesian methods involve weighting a likelihood function
with prior information. I will delve into these ideas in more detail in
their respective topics.</p>
<p>This tutorial serves as an introduction to these topics. I do not
expect you to be able to build your own models after you finish this
tutorial. However, you will develop a working understanding of the
fundamentals of these topics, such that when you do encounter them in
the literature, you can at least understand a little bit of what the
researchers are doing. Furthermore, if you do want to build your own
models in your research, this tutorial will give you enough of a
foundation so that you can teach yourself these concepts or confer with
a statistician to build your own model.</p>

<h2>Probability theory</h2>
<p><strong>Probability</strong> is defined as how <em>likely</em> an
outcome is. We can never predict an outcome with 100% certainty because
the many processes affecting an outcome are complex and variable. The
canonical example of a random process is a coin flip, where the
probability of getting a heads (or tails) is 0.5. There are many
processes that affect a coin flip: where on the coin one flicks, flick
strength, the shape of the coin’s faces, air temperature and turbulence
and how these interact with the coin’s faces, etc. These processes are
each variable, and they interact with each other in complex ways to
ensure that we cannot predict the outcome of a coin flip with 100%
accuracy. We therefore model a coin flip as a 50-50 random process
because we are unable to measure, or are uninterested in measuring, this
myriad of processes.</p>
<p>The probability of some event happening ranges from zero to one, with
zero indicating that the event will never happen and one indicating that
the event will always happen. Numbers in between these two extremes
quantify how likely it is that an event will occur.</p>
<p><img
src="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/probability-line.svg"
style="width:65.0%" /></p>
<p>I will not rehash in this tutorial many of the concepts taught in
lecture (e.g., first axiom of probability, complements, conditional
probabilities) because they do not have R functions directly associated
with them. However, we do need to define some terms first. A
<strong>set</strong> is a collection of outcomes, and a <strong>sample
space</strong> defines the set of <em>all</em> possible outcomes. For
example, when you roll one die, the sample space is {1,2,3,4,5,6} (curly
braces are used to define the elements within a set). An
<strong>event</strong> is any subset of the sample space that is of
interest. For example, the event of rolling an odd number is defined as
{1,3,5}. In probability theory, we are interested in the probability of
an event happening: if rolling an odd number has three possible outcomes
and the sample space has six total outcomes, then the probability of
rolling an odd number is <span class="math inline">\(3/6=0.5\)</span>.
We represent the probability of, for example, event A happening as <span
class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(Pr(A)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-set-operations" class="section level2">
<h2>Set operations</h2>
<p>In lecture, I covered two important set operations: intersections and
unions. The <strong>intersection</strong> between two events is defined
as the elements that those two events have in common (though you can
compute the intersection between as many events as you want!). If we are
interested in the intersection of events A and B, this is represented as
<span class="math inline">\(A\cap B\)</span> or simply <span
class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>. In probability theory, intersections
are associated with multiplying the probabilities of events together,
assuming the events are independent.</p>
<p>In R, we can use the <code>intersect()</code> function to get out the
elements in common between two vectors (can be useful for data
wrangling!). Let’s define <code>A &lt;- 1:3</code> and
<code>B &lt;- 2:4</code>. What do you think you’ll get when you enter
<code>intersect(A, B)</code>? Check your intuition below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="intersect"

<pre class="text"><code># Click &quot;Solution&quot; button if stuck </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="intersect-solution"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>A &lt;- 1:3
B &lt;- 2:4

intersect(A, B)
length(intersect(A, B)) / 6

union(A, B) # compare with unique(c(A, B))
length(union(A, B)) / 6

setdiff(A, B)
setdiff(B, A)

setequal(A, B)
setequal(1:3, 3:1)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If we view <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> as two events each
representing the roll of one die, <span class="math inline">\(P(A\cap
B)\)</span> equals <code>length(intersect(A, B)) / 6</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>union</strong> between two events is defined as the set
of all outcomes that are in either or both events (though you can
calculate the union between more than two events). For example, the
union of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> above is {1,2,3,4}. Unions
are represented with a <span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>, e.g.,
the union between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(A \cup
B\)</span>. In probability theory, unions are associated with adding the
probabilities of events together, assuming the events are mutually
exclusive.</p>
<p>What do you think you’ll get when you enter <code>union(A, B)</code>
above? Assuming again that <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are two
events each representing the roll of one die, <span
class="math inline">\(P(A \cup B)\)</span> equals
<code>length(union(A, B)) / 6</code>. <strong>NB:</strong>
<code>union(A, B)</code> is identical to <code>unique(c(A, B))</code>;
that is, <code>unique()</code> ensures that elements are not duplicated,
which is the case with unions.</p>
<p>Other useful set operation functions in R are <code>setdiff()</code>
and <code>setequal()</code>. <code>setdiff()</code> takes two vectors as
arguments and returns the elements in the first vector that are not in
the second. What do you think you’ll get when you enter
<code>setdiff(A, B)</code>? What about <code>setdiff(B, A)</code>?
<code>setequal()</code> also takes two vectors as arguments and returns
<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>, depending on whether all the
elements in the first vector are found in the second. Try
<code>setequal(A, B)</code> and then
<code>setequal(1:3, 3:1)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-probability-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Probability distributions</h2>
<p>We quantify how likely certain outcomes within the sample space are
with <strong>probability distributions</strong>. Probability
distributions are defined as mathematical functions, but they can also
be portrayed graphically. The shape of a distribution is determined by
<strong>parameters</strong>, which are numbers input into the
distribution (or estimated from data). These concepts will become
clearer when we go over an example in the next topic.</p>

<div id="section-probability-mass-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Probability mass functions</h2>
<p><strong>Probability mass functions</strong> (PMF) describe discrete
random variables whose outcomes are finite or countable (e.g.,
integers).</p>
<div id="section-binomial-pmf" class="section level3">
<h3>Binomial PMF</h3>
<p>One very popular PMF is the <strong>binomial PMF</strong>, which
quantifies the probability of getting <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> successes in <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials, given the probability of
success is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This function can be
used to calculate, for example, the probability of getting three heads
(<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) in three flips (<span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>), given the probability of getting
heads is 0.5 (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>). The mathematical
function for the binomial PMF is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \frac{n!}{X!(n-X)!} p^x (1-p)^{n-X}.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>By inserting <span class="math inline">\(X=3\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> into the equation above, we get
0.125, which is the probability of getting three heads in three coin
flips when the coin is fair (i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>).</p>
<p>Instead of plugging numbers into equations and solving them, we can
take advantage of R’s functions to do the work for us.
<code>dbinom()</code> gives us the probability resulting from given
values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for the binomial PMF. Thus, we can
calculate the probability for <span class="math inline">\(X=3\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> by entering
<code>dbinom(x = 3, size = 3, prob = 0.5)</code>. Try this out
below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="binom" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Click &quot;Solution&quot; button if stuck</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>

<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="binom-solution"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"

<pre class="text"><code>dbinom(x = 3, size = 3, prob = 0.5)

dbinom(x = 0:3, size = 3, prob = 0.5)

sum(dbinom(0:3, 3, 0.5))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Let’s generalize our three heads example to the probability of
flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads (i.e., the entire sample space), so we can
get a distribution. Similar to before, I’m interested in the number of
heads obtained in three coin flips. The entire sample space is {TTT,
HTT, THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}. Therefore, the probability of
getting no heads is <span class="math inline">\(P(X=0)=1/8\)</span>, the
probability of getting one head is <span
class="math inline">\(P(X=1)=3/8\)</span>, the probability of getting
two heads is <span class="math inline">\(P(X=2)=3/8\)</span>, and the
probability of getting three heads is <span
class="math inline">\(P(X=3)=1/8\)</span> (which is what we calculated
above). Instead of listing all possible outcomes in the sample space,
which becomes very tedious with more coin flips, these probabilities can
be obtained by inserting the number of heads of interest (<span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) into the equation above along with
<span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>. Or we can use R and enter
<code>dbinom(x = 0:3, size = 3, prob = 0.5)</code>. The resulting
distribution (and plotting code) is shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 0:3
plot(
  x, 
  dbinom(x, 3, prob = 0.5), 
  type = &quot;h&quot;, 
  lwd = 3, 
  xlab = &quot;Number of heads&quot;, 
  ylab = &quot;Probability&quot;, 
  main = &quot;Binomial PMF; n = 3, p = 0.5&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<div class="figure">

<strong>Figure 2.</strong> A binomial PMF quantifies the probability of

parameters: <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see from this figure that the probability of getting one or
two heads in three flips is the same, and this probability is three
times greater than the probability of flipping zero or three heads.
<strong>NB:</strong> because 0, 1, 2, and 3 heads comprise the entire
sample space when three coins are flipped, their respective
probabilities sum to one. You can see this with
<code>sum(dbinom(0:3, 3, 0.5))</code>. More generally, the sample space
of a binomial PMF always ranges from zero to <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>; the sample space of a function is also
called the <strong>support</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-poisson-pmf" class="section level3">
<h3>Poisson PMF</h3>
<p>Another popular PMF is the <strong>Poisson PMF</strong>, which
describes the probability of getting <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> occurrences in a fixed area or time
period, given an average number of occurrences in that area/time. The
average number of occurrences (<span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) is the one parameter in the
Poisson PMF. The mathematical function for this distribution is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \frac{\lambda^X e^{-\lambda}}{X!}.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>It can be used to calculate, for example, the probability of getting
no phone calls received in an hour (<span
class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span>), given that the average number of
calls per hour is two (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda=2\)</span>).
Inserting <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda=2\)</span> into the equation above, we get
0.135. In R speak, <code>dpois(x = 0, lambda = 2)</code>. The full
distribution for values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
between zero and 10 is shown below (the entire sample space of a Poisson
PMF always ranges from zero to infinity).</p>

<p>Other popular PMFs are the discrete uniform (<code>dunif()</code>),

<h2>Probability density functions</h2>
<p><strong>Probability density functions</strong> describe random
variables whose outcomes can take on any value within a smooth interval
(e.g., height).</p>
<div id="section-normal-pdf" class="section level3">
<h3>Normal PDF</h3>
<p>By far, the most popular PDF is the <strong>normal
distribution</strong>, which describes how likely a value of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is, given two parameters determining
the shape of the distribution: mean (<span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) and standard deviation (<span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>). The corresponding mathematical
function is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{X -
\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2\right).
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The sample space for a normal distribution ranges from negative
infinity to infinity.</p>
<p>Again, R allows us to ignore all this messy math and use its built-in
functions to calculate these probabilities. For example the probability
that <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> in a normal distribution
where <span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma=1\)</span> (i.e., the standard normal
distribution) is 0.4; this can be calculated with
<code>dnorm(0, mean = 0, sd = 1)</code>. We can plot the entire standard
normal distribution for a given range of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> values as shown below (I used a minimum
of -3 and a maximum of 3).</p>

<h3>Lognormal PDF</h3>
<p>Another popular PDF is the <strong>lognormal distribution</strong>,
which becomes normally distributed when log-transformed. While normal
distributions describe variables that are each the outcome of many
processes <em>additively</em> combined (cf. central limit theorem),
lognormal distributions describe variables that are each the outcome of
many processes <em>multiplicatively</em> combined (or additively
combined in log space). Therefore, lognormal distributions describe many
variables in the real world. Part of this is also due to the lognormal
distribution’s incredible flexibility. As the lognormal’s measure of
dispersion approaches zero, its shape becomes normal (e.g., compare
<code>hist(rlnorm(1000))</code> to
<code>hist(rlnorm(1000, sdlog = 1e-10))</code>). As the dispersion
becomes large, the lognormal approaches the power distribution, which
also characterizes many real world patterns.</p>

<h2>Cumulative distribution functions</h2>
<p>Each PMF and PDF has a cumulative distribution function associated
with it. The <strong>cumulative distribution function</strong> (CDF) is
a mathematical function that quantifies the probability that <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will take on a value less than or equal
to some value. As a simple example, the CDF can be used to calculate the
probability that one will roll a die and get a three or less. This
probability is <span class="math inline">\(P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) =
1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a more interesting example, we can revisit our Poisson PMF from
before and calculate the probability that one will receive three or less
phone calls in one hour, given that the average number of phone calls
per hour is two (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=2\)</span>).
This is equivalent to summing the probabilities that one will receive
zero, one, two, or three calls, i.e.,
<code>sum(dpois(0:3, lambda = 2))</code>. We can also use the CDF
directly in R: <code>ppois(3, lambda = 2)</code> (compare this result
with the one using <code>sum(dpois())</code>). Therefore, the CDF sums
up and calculates the <em>cumulative</em> probability up to and
including some number of interest.</p>

<div id="section-p-values" class="section level3">
<h3>P-values</h3>
<p>In frequentist tests, the CDF is most commonly used to calculate
P-values. Recall that a P-value is defined as the probability of getting
a test statistic at least as extreme as that observed, assuming the null
hypothesis is true. That is, one builds a distribution of the test
statistic expected if the null hypothesis is true, and then calculates
the probability of getting a value more extreme than observed.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> Anytime you encounter the words “at least”, “at
most”, “less than”, or “greater than” in probability, think CDFs.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this with an example. Let’s say we wanted to test if
the red group in the figure below is significantly larger than the blue
group (i.e., this is a one-tailed t-test). The observed t-statistic is
0.81, so we want to calculate the probability of getting values of t
that are greater than or equal to 0.81. This is equivalent to using the
CDF for the t-distribution, i.e., <code>pt()</code>.</p>

One can calculate the area using the CDF for the t-distribtion." width="624" />

<p>Let’s do this in the console below (I have already written the code
for the two groups for you in the console; the object names are
<code>red</code> and <code>blue</code>). Let’s make R do the work for us
by having it calculate the t-statistic and degrees of freedom, which is
the one parameter in the t-distribution that is a function of sample
size. These numbers can be complicated to compute, so we will have R do
it for us using <code>t.test()</code>. So enter
<code>t.res &lt;- t.test(red, blue, alternative = "greater")</code>
(<code>alternative = "greater"</code> is telling R that we’re doing a
one-tailed test, testing if the first-entered object is significantly
larger than the second-entered object). Then use the t-distribution’s
CDF to calculate the P-value:
<code>1 - pt(t.res$statistic, t.res$parameter)</code> or
<code>pt(t.res$statistic, t.res$parameter, lower.tail = FALSE)</code>.
As you can see, the resulting probability is exactly the same as the
P-value from <code>t.test()</code>! So every time R returns a P-value,
it is doing so using the CDF for the null distribution of interest
(e.g., t-distribution, F-distribution, chi-squared distribution).</p>

<p>Perhaps by now, you’ve picked up on the fact that each probability
distribution has a number of R functions associated with it,
specifically four. Using the normal distribution as an example (grayed
letters refer to arguments in their respective functions):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>rnorm()</code> generates <code>n</code> random numbers from a
normal distribution, given the parameters of the distribution.</li>
<li><code>dnorm()</code> returns the probability of getting a value,

<li><code>pnorm()</code> returns the probability of getting a number
<code>q</code> or smaller (i.e., the cumulative probability), given the
parameters of the distribution.</li>
<li><code>qnorm()</code>, which I haven’t covered, returns the value
(i.e., <strong>quantile</strong> or <strong>percentile</strong>)
associated with a given cumulative probability value, <code>p</code>.
Thus, you can think of <code>qnorm()</code> as being the inverse of
<code>pnorm()</code>. For example, <code>qnorm(0.75)</code> will give us
the value associated with the 75th percentile in this distribution, and
entering this value into <code>pnorm()</code> will return 0.75. The
<code>qxxx()</code> functions are most useful for obtaining the critical
value for a test statistic (e.g.,
<code>qt(p = 0.95, df = t.res$parameter)</code> tells us that our
observed t-statistic, which was 0.81, needed to exceed 1.69 to be
significant at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>).
Similarly, <code>qnorm()</code> can be used to tell us the values
associated with a 95% confidence interval for a given sampling
distribution (e.g., for a standard normal sampling distribution,
<code>qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975))</code> returns -1.96 and 1.96).</li>

<h2>Fundamentals of likelihood</h2>
<p>As I alluded to in the <em>Introduction</em>,
<strong>likelihood</strong> is a principled frequentist framework for
statistical inference, first developed by R.A. Fisher. It allows one to
build a model from scratch in order to estimate parameters, test
hypotheses (e.g., compute the P-value for an estimated parameter), and
perform model selection. We will learn how to do all three in R.</p>
<p><img
src="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5712cd7-b1e1-4cb2-95cd-14469a2a2211/sign619-gra-0001-m.png"
style="width:30.0%" /></p>
<p>Traditional inference in frequentist statistics is concerned with the
probability of the data, given some hypothesized parameter value or
model: <span class="math inline">\(P(D|M)\)</span>. For example,
P-values calculate the probability of getting the data (or more
extreme), assuming some parameter value associated with the null
hypothesis. Likelihood flips this conditional probability and is
interested in the probability of the parameter value or model, given the
data: <span class="math inline">\(P(M|D)\)</span>. This is often the
more direct question of interest for researchers: given the data, they
want to know something about the parameter/hypothesis/model. Traditional
inference, on the other hand, first assumes some parameter value
(usually the null value), assesses how probable the observed data are
under this null value, and then makes an inferential statement about the
parameter (a very circuitous form of inference!).</p>
<p>Here is another quick example. Traditional inference asks what is the
probability of getting four heads in 10 coin flips (the data), given
that <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> (the assumed model
parameter). Likelihood asks how likely is <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> (the model parameter), given that
you get four heads in 10 coin flips (the data).</p>
<p>The key step in likelihood methods is figuring out how to translate
your research question into probabilities and probability distributions.
From there, you can derive the <strong>likelihood function</strong>,
which describes how likely certain parameter values are, given the data.
Everything in likelihood inference has to do with maximizing the
likelihood: the best parameter estimate is the one with the largest
likelihood, a parameter is significant if the model’s likelihood
increases by an acceptable amount relative to the null model, and a
model is preferred over another if, again, the likelihood increases by
some acceptable amount. All of this will become clearer when we go over
an example together.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-maximum-likelihood-estimation" class="section level2">
<h2>Maximum likelihood estimation</h2>
<p>Likelihood provides a framework for estimating unknown parameter(s)
in a model. Specifically, the estimated parameter is the value that
makes the observed data most probable (i.e., has the highest
likelihood). This is known as the <strong>maximum likelihood
estimate</strong> (MLE).</p>
<p>We will use the lion stalking success example from lecture to
illustrate how MLE works. In Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, <a
href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z77-235">Elliott et

<p>First, we need to pick the appropriate probability distribution to
model these data. Assuming stalks are independent, we can model stalk
rate using the binomial distribution. A good, naive guess of stalk rate
is <span class="math inline">\(p=34/157=0.22\)</span>. The left plot in
the figure below shows the binomial PMF, which portrays the probability
of getting <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> successful stalks,
given that there are 157 total stalks (<span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) and the probability of a successful
stalk is <span class="math inline">\(p=0.22\)</span>. This is the
“traditional” view of statistical inference, asking what is the
probability of the data, given some assumed parameter. Likelihood flips
this conditional probability and asks what is the likelihood that the
parameter is some value, given the data. This is the right plot in the
figure below, and the curve/function is the <strong>likelihood
function</strong>.</p>

  lwd = 2, 
  xlab = &quot;X (number of successful stalks)&quot;, 
  ylab = &quot;P(X | p)&quot;, 
  main = &quot;Probability (assuming p = 0.22)&quot;
  )

  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="Week14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>There are three key things to note from this figure. 1) Because
probability makes a statement about the data (given the parameter), it
is plotting number of stalks (a discrete variable) on the x-axis.
Likelihood makes a statement about the parameter (given the data), so
the x-axis is stalking success rate (a continuous variable). 2)
Probability and likelihood are numerically equivalent, as can be seen
from the identical y-axes and shapes of the distributions. As a more
specific example, the probability of getting 34 successful stalks, given
157 total stalks and a success rate of 0.22, is equivalent to the
likelihood of getting <span class="math inline">\(p=0.22\)</span>, given
34 successful stalks and 157 total stalks (i.e., 0.08;
<code>dbinom(x = 34, size = 157, p = 0.22)</code>). 3) Likelihoods are
not true probabilities, as they don’t satisfy the first axiom of
probability. That is, the area under the curve does not sum to one. We
can see this by defining the likelihood function first
(<code>likelihood &lt;- function(p) dbinom(x = 34, size = 157, prob = p)</code>)
and then integrating from zero to one
(<code>integrate(likelihood, 0, 1)</code>). The violation of the first
axiom is OK, since we’re only concerned with which parameter values have
higher likelihoods relative to others (i.e., we’re never interested in
the absolute likelihood values).</p>

easier to work with the log-transform of likelihood functions, and this

<p>For simple log-likelihood functions like ours, the maximum can be
found by taking the derivative of the function, setting it equal to
zero, and then solving for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This
gives us <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}=X/n=0.22\)</span>, which
matches our naive estimate (the “hat” indicates that this is an estimate
of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>), but we’ve now formally
derived it in the framework of likelihood. For more complex functions,
we have to use a computer to find the maximum, which it does by trial
and error over multiple iterations. As an exercise, we can do this for
our log-likelihood function:
<code>optimize(dbinom, x = 34, size = 157, log = TRUE, lower = 0, upper = 1, maximum = TRUE)</code>.
The first argument is the function we want to find the maximum of, the
next three arguments are those passed onto <code>dbinom()</code>,
<code>lower =</code> and <code>upper =</code> define the upper and lower
bounds of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and
<code>maximum = TRUE</code> tells R we want to find the maximum. As you
can see, we get the same answer as above.</p>

<div id="section-likelihood-ratio-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Likelihood ratio tests</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve found the MLE of lion stalking success rate, we can
conduct a hypothesis test to test if the MLE is significantly different
from some other hypothesized value (in lecture, I used <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.1\)</span>, which I rationalized as being the
theoretical stalk success rate as seen in the published literature).
This is done using a <strong>likelihood ratio test</strong> (LRT). A LRT
asks if the MLE of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> results in a
likelihood that is significantly larger than that from a null model
(e.g., where <span class="math inline">\(p=0.1\)</span>).</p>
<p>LRTs can only be done when comparing two nested models. For example,
y ~ x1 is nested within y ~ x1 + x2 because the second model is the same
as the first but with an extra parameter. Revisiting our stalk success
example, our null model (M<sub>0</sub>) is <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.1\)</span>. We <em>a priori</em> set <span
class="math inline">\(p=0.1\)</span>, so there are no estimated free
parameters. Our alternative model (M<sub>1</sub>) allowed <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to vary and be estimated, so there is
one extra free parameter compared to M<sub>0</sub>. Thus, M<sub>0</sub>
is nested within M<sub>1</sub>. Recalling that increasing the number of
free parameters in a linear model can only increase R<sup>2</sup>, the
same is true in likelihood: adding free parameters can only increase the
likelihood (after all, likelihood is a measure of goodness of fit). LRTs
ask if the extra free parameter increases the likelihood above and
beyond any difference expected from sampling error (i.e., the parameter
is statistically significant).</p>
<p>To do a LRT, we first calculate the likelihood ratio (hence the
name): M<sub>0</sub>’s likelihood divided by M<sub>1</sub>’s likelihood.
Note that this ratio ranges from zero to one, since the more complex
model’s (M<sub>1</sub>) likelihood can only be greater than or equal to
that of the simpler model (M<sub>0</sub>). Similar to before, we work
with log-likelihoods, so the log-transformed likelihood ratio becomes
the difference between two log-likelihoods: <span
class="math inline">\(\textrm{log}(L(M_0)/L(M_1)) = \textrm{log}(L(M_0))
- \textrm{log}(L(M_1))\)</span>. It has been demonstrated that -2 times
the difference in log-likelihoods follows a chi-square distribution if
the null hypothesis is true (i.e., this is how we get our null sampling
distribution; see figure below). The number of degrees of freedom is
equal to the difference in number of free parameters between our models,
which is one in our case.</p>
<p>We can apply all of the above to our stalk success example to
calculate the P-value for our MLE (see code below). As you can see, the
P-value is significant, illustrating that our MLE of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is significantly different from the
hypothesized <span class="math inline">\(p=0.1\)</span>.</p>

<h3>The <code>lrtest()</code> function</h3>
<p>We can use the <code>lrtest()</code> function from the

let’s say I wanted to compare

model, with <code>M1 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)</code>. I would
enter <code>lrtest(M0, M1)</code>. As you can see, the P-value is
significant, indicating that the more complicated model with
<code>wt</code> as an IV (M<sub>1</sub>) has a significantly larger
likelihood than the model with no IVs (M<sub>0</sub>).</p>

<div id="section-akaike-information-criterion" class="section level2">
<h2>Akaike Information Criterion</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in our very first lecture, a powerful form of
scientific inference is to compare models on equal footing, as opposed
to privileging one model over another (e.g., null hypothesis tests
privilege the null hypothesis by requiring a very low P-value for
rejection). This is a form of <strong>model selection</strong>, where
one uses statistics to choose one model from a set of candidate models,
given how well each fits the data. A commonly used criterion in model
selection is the <strong>Akaike Information Criterion</strong> (AIC).
AIC recognizes that a more complex model (i.e., one with more free
parameters) will always fit the data better than a simpler model. AIC
thus accordingly balances goodness of fit (i.e., the log-likelihood)
with model complexity (i.e., the number of free parameters): <span
class="math inline">\(\textrm{AIC} = -2\textrm{log}L + 2K\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the number of free
parameters in the model. AIC measures the amount of information lost in
approximating reality with a model, so a lower AIC means better model
support.</p>
<p>There is also a bias-corrected form of AIC, which is preferred if
sample sizes are not large (i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(n/K&lt;40\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is sample size). The formula for this
is <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AIC}_c=\textrm{AIC} +
(2K[K+1])/(n-K-1)\)</span>. AIC<sub>c</sub> approaches AIC as sample
size increases, so one should always use the AIC<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p>Let’s calculate the AIC and AIC<sub>c</sub> for each of our two
stalking success models (see code below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># null model&#39;s (M0) log-likelihood
logL_M0 &lt;- dbinom(x = 34, size = 157, p = 0.1, log = TRUE)

<p>Whether using AIC or AIC<sub>c</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>’s score is ~23.5
and M<sub>1</sub>’s score is ~7.1. A general rule is that an AIC or
AIC<sub>c</sub> difference of more than two means strong model support,
so M<sub>1</sub> has much stronger support than M<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>A more interpretable way to present AIC results, in my opinion, is to
transform AIC scores into weights. AIC weights sum to one across all
models, with higher weights indicating more support. We can calculate
AIC weights using the <code>akaike.weights()</code> function from the
<code>qpcR</code> package:
<code>akaike.weights(c(AIC_M0, AIC_M1))</code> or
<code>akaike.weights(c(AICc_M0, AICc_M1))</code>. As you can see,
M<sub>1</sub> has much more support than M<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>The real strength of AIC, however, lies in comparing
<em>non</em>-nested models with different numbers of parameters. For
example, let’s say I wanted to compare
<code>M1 &lt;- lm(qsec ~ wt, data = mtcars)</code> with
<code>M2 &lt;- lm(qsec ~ hp + mpg, data = mtcars)</code>. To get the AIC
scores, we would enter <code>AIC(M1)</code> and <code>AIC(M2)</code>. To
get the AIC<sub>c</sub> scores, we use the <code>AICc()</code> function
from the <code>qpcR</code> package: <code>AICc(M1)</code> and
<code>AICc(M2)</code>. As before, we can transform either AIC or
AIC<sub>c</sub> scores to weights using
<code>akaike.weights()</code>.</p>

<h2>Bayesian paradigm</h2>
<p>The third and final topic of this tutorial covers statistical
inference using the Bayesian paradigm. This paradigm has two substantive
differences compared to the frequentist paradigm:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Probability quantifies one’s <em>uncertainty</em> or <em>degree of
belief</em> in an event happening (i.e., <strong>subjective
probability</strong>). This is different than the frequentist definition
of probability, which is defined as the relative frequency of some event
happening in the long run.</li>
<li>The incorporation of prior information in models.</li>
</ol>
<p>Covering the first point quickly, I pose the question, “What is the
probability that Vermont is larger than New Hampshire?” A frequentist
would say that it is nonsensical to place a probability on this question
because Vermont is either larger than New Hampshire or it is not. This
is a mere fact, and there is no randomness involved (so the probability
is either zero or one depending on whether Vermont is indeed larger than
New Hampshire). A Bayesian would say that they’re not exactly sure
whether Vermont is larger, and their provided probability would reflect
this uncertainty. The more certain one is about the answer to this
question, the higher the probability would be.</p>
<p><img

style="width:40.0%" /></p>
<p>The second point concerns whether one should incorporate information
external to the dataset (i.e., <strong>prior information</strong>) when
making inferences. This is a very contentious feature of Bayesian
statistics (as is the first point). Conversely, it can be argued that
inference is never done in a vacuum, and there’s always important prior
information available. For example, a presidential approval rating poll
in a county gives 41% even though other organizations got around 55% in
the same county. Should the first poll ignore the others’ results, even
though it’s the outlier? Moreover, one’s dataset can be
nonrepresentative or incomplete, and it would behoove any researcher to
incorporate prior information to ameliorate this. Bayesian methods offer
a principled, formalized, and transparent way of combining prior
information with data when making statistical inferences.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will go over how one uses Bayes’ theorem to
combine prior information with the likelihood function to get the
posterior probability distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-bayes-theorem" class="section level2">
<h2>Bayes’ theorem</h2>
<p>Much like likelihood, Bayesians are interested in the probability of
some hypothesis/model/parameter, given the data. This is known as the
<strong>posterior probability</strong>, which is most informative when
characterized as a distribution. The posterior probability distribution
is proportional to the prior probability times the likelihood function.
The <strong>prior probability</strong> is a probability distribution
that quantifies all the prior information regarding some quantity of
interest. All this is formalized with Bayes’ theorem (or rule), which
is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  P(H|D) = \frac{P(H)P(D|H)}{P(D)},
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P(H)\)</span> is the prior
distribution, <span class="math inline">\(P(D|H)\)</span> is the
likelihood function, and <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span> is a
scaling factor that makes the area under the posterior probability
distribution sum to one (so posterior probabilities are true
probabilities). Note that this formula is a slight elaboration of the
multiplication rule in probability theory.</p>
<div id="section-motivating-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivating example</h3>
<p>To make Bayes’ theorem concrete, I will use the example from lecture.

<em>Primetime</em> ran an experiment addressing this question and found
that 40 out of 40 officer returned the lost wallet with
<strong>NO</strong> money missing.</p>

<div id="section-formulating-the-prior-distribution"
class="section level3">
<h3>Formulating the prior distribution</h3>
<p>Let’s say I think this probability is low (around 0.3) but not zero.
Furthermore, I’m not very confident in my 0.3 guesstimate, so I will
make the distribution wide. The standard distribution for modeling a
probability is the <strong>beta distribution</strong>, which is
continuous from zero to one and can take on a number of different
shapes, as determined by its two parameters: <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> (see figure below). <a

<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000)

  p,

<p>From the plot of the likelihood function, you can probably guess that
the <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{MLE}\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is zero. But do we really expect that
<strong>NO</strong> officers would have stolen any money? It could be
that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in reality is greater than
zero but very small; that is, if we had a larger sample size, we might
sample that one elusive crooked officer. Because our prior distribution
is not concentrated on zero, this ensures that the final estimate of
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (using the posterior
distribution) will be greater than zero, even though the data are
concentrated at zero. This is one of the advantages of Bayesian methods:
“adjusting” the data when it is nonrepresentative or incomplete. A
frequentist, on the other hand, would estimate <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as zero.</p>

<h3>Combining the prior with the likelihood to get the posterior
distribution</h3>
<p>As we saw in Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability distribution
is simply the prior times the likelihood, divided by the scaling factor.
Oftentimes, we can safely ignore the scaling factor, which is often
difficult to calculate. The resulting probability distribution looks
identical, but the scale of the y-axis changes. This is OK because we
only care about which values of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
are more probable than others. When we drop the scaling factor, the
posterior probability is not equal to but proportional to the prior
times the likelihood, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(P(H|D) \propto
P(H)P(D|H)\)</span>. This revised formula emphasizes how the prior
distribution can be thought of as weighting certain values of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the likelihood function. It also
emphasizes that when an uninformative prior is used (i.e., all values of
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are equally probable), this just
becomes a likelihood analysis.</p>
<p>I plotted the posterior distribution below by simply multiplying the
prior and likelihood by all common values of <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We can see that the prior distribution
“dragged” the likelihood away from zero.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000)

prior &lt;- dbeta(p, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 3)
likelihood &lt;- dbinom(x = 0, size = 40, prob = p)

posterior &lt;- prior * likelihood

plot(
  p, 
  posterior, 
  type = &quot;l&quot;, 
  lwd = 2, 
  ylab = &quot;P(H|D)&quot;, 
  main = &quot;Posterior distribution&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="Week14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>One can also use algebra to multiply the beta PDF by the binomial PMF
to get the posterior PDF: <span class="math inline">\(p^{\alpha + X -
1}(1-p)^{\beta + n - X - 1}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are the parameters of the beta
prior (i.e., 2 and 3), <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the
number of officers who stole money (i.e., 0), and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of officers sampled
(i.e., 40). Note that the posterior PDF is itself a beta distribution
with new parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1 = \alpha +
X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = \beta + n -
X\)</span> (when the prior and posterior distributions are the same
(e.g., beta), the prior is known as a <strong>conjugate prior</strong>;
this means we can get an equation for the posterior distribution, which
was important before fast computers). Because statisticians know the
formula for calculating the mean of a beta distribution (<span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}\)</span>), we can
use the new beta parameters to compute the posterior mean, which is
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_1 + \beta_1} =
\frac{\alpha + X}{(\alpha + X) + (\beta + n - X)}\)</span>. Plugging in
the proper numbers gives a mean of about 0.04, which is our estimate of
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> using Bayes’ theorem. We can also
use <code>qbeta()</code> to get the 95% confidence interval, termed
<strong>credible interval</strong> in Bayesian inference:
<code>qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), shape1 = 2 + 0, shape2 = 3 + 40 - 0)</code>.</p>

<p>This graph plots the posterior mean estimate as a function of sample
size, with the mean of the prior distribution plotted as a horizontal
red line. When sample size is small, there is not much information
contained in the data, so the prior dominates. As sample size increases,
the MLE of the likelihood (i.e., zero) takes over. In other words, the
data dominate and “speak for themselves.”</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we covered what can be considered the fundamentals
of statistical inference. As we’ve seen in <em>Cumulative distribution
functions</em> and <em>dxxx(), pxxx(), qxxx(), rxxx()</em>, probability
theory is central to calculating P-values and confidence intervals.
Probability theory itself can also be used to create models and new
statistical tests, addressing questions that cannot be answered using
more “traditional” frequentist tests. One example of this in
paleoanthropology is from <a
href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/5/eaav9038">Du and
Alemseged (2019)</a>. In this article, the authors created a probability
model in order to calculate a P-value for the hypothesis that a hominin
species, <em>Australopithecus sediba</em>, was actually ancestral to the
genus <em>Homo</em> (a much more interesting hypothesis than your
traditional H<sub>0</sub>!). In fact, after having gone through the
tutorial, I bet you can understand at least 70% of the <em>Materials and
Methods</em> in that paper.</p>
<p>We also covered statistical inference using likelihood. Likelihood is
a principled framework for creating your own models, estimating
parameters, conducting hypothesis tests, and performing model selection.
Maximum likelihood estimates of parameters have good statistical
properties: as sample size increases and approaches infinity, (1) the
estimate becomes unbiased, (2) the estimate has the smallest possible
variance among all unbiased estimators (i.e., it is precise), and (3)
the sampling distribution is normal (so you can calculate 95% confidence
intervals as ±1.96 * SE). All that is required when building likelihood
models is knowing how to translate your research question and quantities
of interest into probability distributions and how to combine those
distributions to get a likelihood function. All this takes experience
and practice.</p>
<p>The last inferential framework I covered is the Bayesian paradigm. It
may seem complicated at first, but all it involves is weighting the
likelihood function with the prior probability distribution. As a
result, if you’re familiar with likelihood methods, you already
understand 90% of Bayesian statistics. While many may view the
incorporation of prior information into one’s analysis as a subjective
and borderline unethical exercise, I believe that this is a great
strength of Bayesian methods. I can think of exactly zero instances
where humans make decisions without drawing on prior experience (either
consciously or subconsciously). Bayesian methods offer a principled,
formalized, and transparent way of combining prior information with the
data, whereas most researchers do so in a non-transparent, ad hoc
manner. The Bayesian interpretation of a confidence interval (i.e.,
credible interval) is also more intuitive: a 95% credible interval means
that there’s a 95% probability that the parameter lies within the
estimated interval.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the <em>Introduction</em>, I do not expect you to
be able to build your own models after the lecture and this tutorial.
However, you should have a better understanding of these methods so that
when you do encounter them in the literature, you should have a good
idea of what the researchers are doing. And if you do wish to explore
these methods for your own research, you have a solid enough foundation
where you can read more about these topics and/or collaborate with a
statistician to build your own model.
