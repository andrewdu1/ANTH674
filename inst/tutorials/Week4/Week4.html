<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week, we are moving on from describing our data using plots and
descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, variance) and are now
entering the realm of <strong><em>inferential statistics</em></strong>.
<strong><em>Statistical inference</em></strong> is concerned with
estimating, inferring, and understanding some property of some unknown
<strong><em>statistical population</em></strong> by analyzing a sample
from said population. Statistical inference plays a key role in
scientific inference, where we want to understand something about some
larger pattern or process from the data we collect.</p>
<p><img
src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jkAuzUQXZj4/VBubLQpmjdI/AAAAAAAACfI/UwpokJd-jVA/s1600/PopulationSample.gif"
style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>By far, the most common type of statistical inference is
<strong><em>frequentist inference</em></strong> (the counterpart is
Bayesian inference; the two factions have a nasty, warring history with
each other). Frequentism starts with a, often abstract and unknowable,
statistical population, from which one sample out of theoretically
infinity is taken. For example, let’s say I was interested in the mean
stature of the <em>Homo erectus</em> species. FYI, this is what <em>H.
erectus</em> looked like:</p>
<p><img
src="http://humanorigins.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumbnail/public/images/landscape/erectus_JC_Recon_Head_CC_f_l.jpg.webp?itok=TYqVFFcz"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>There is certainly a statistical population of all <em>Homo
erectus</em> individuals who have ever lived, but the fossil record
preserves only some individuals, and we can estimate stature only for
those individuals. These individuals provide a
<strong><em>sample</em></strong>, from which we make inferences about
the unknown population. Let’s imagine the history of Earth is rewound
and replayed and through sheer happenstance another set of <em>H.
erectus</em> individuals is preserved for us to analyze. This is another
replicate sample from the population, and we can imagine a theoretically
infinite number of rewindings and alternate dimensions, which provides
us with theoretically infinite sample replicates from the <em>H.
erectus</em> statistical population.</p>
<p>If we wanted to instead analyze a statistical population that is
knowable and measurable (e.g., the masses of all people who have landed
on the Moon), then we wouldn’t need inferential statistics!</p>
<p>We will sharpen our understanding of how frequentism works through
simulations in R. This is one of the best things about R: you can
test/strengthen your intuition about certain concepts by simulating
data! We will then learn about estimating some quantity of the
population (i.e., <strong><em>parameter</em></strong>), which is
ultimately unknown and can only be inferred through the sample. We will
also quantify the uncertainty around parameter estimates with
<strong><em>confidence intervals</em></strong>. And lastly, we will
learn how <strong><em>P-values</em></strong> are used to test hypotheses
about the population by analyzing data from the sample.</p>
<p>Therefore, the lecture and this tutorial cover the foundation of
inferential statistics, which lays the groundwork for all the tests
we’re going to learn about in weeks to come. In practice, these concepts
become second-nature and are not explicitly thought about when analyzing
data in one’s research. Thus, I will tend to emphasize the behavior of
these statistics (e.g., confidence intervals, P-values) more than their
theoretical underpinnings.</p>

<h2>The frequentist perspective</h2>
<p>This section will teach you what frequentism is by conducting many of
the simulations I used in lecture. Let’s start with coin flips.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-frequentist-probability" class="section level2">
<h2>Frequentist probability</h2>
<p>According to a frequentist, probability is defined 100% empirically.
That is, the probability of some event happening is defined as the
long-run frequency of that event happening divided by the number of
possible opportunities. For example, the probability of flipping heads
is known to be 0.5 because if we were to flip a coin many, many times
(preferably infinity), half of those flips would be heads. Let’s learn
more about this through simulating random data.</p>
<p><img
src="https://psmag.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MTMzNTIwNTUwOTIzMzg4OTM4/shutterstock_109028771jpg.webp"
style="width:40.0%" /></p>
<p>A coin flip can either come up heads or tails. With two outcomes,
this is a binomial random variable (“random” because we don’t know with
100% certainty whether a given coin flip will come up heads or tails).
So, let’s use <code>rbinom()</code> to generate one trial of two coin
flips. The first argument is the number of trials to conduct, the second
argument is how many coin flips to do in one trial, and the third
argument is the probability of getting heads (i.e., 0.5). So, enter
<code>rbinom(1, 2, 0.5)</code> below. The answer you get is how many
heads you flipped.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="coin" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># Click &quot;Solution&quot; if stuck</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="coin-solution"
data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1"
data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># first argument is number of trials
hist(rbinom(10, 2, 0.5))
mean(rbinom(10, 2, 0.5))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You might have gotten a 0, 1, or 2 because there is randomness (i.e.,
<strong><em>stochasticity</em></strong>) involved in flipping coins. You
can rerun the code multiple times to see the three different
outcomes.</p>
<p>Now let’s do the same but with 10 trials. Can you figure out which
argument to modify? You can plot a histogram of the results and/or
calculate the mean to see what the average number of heads is across 10
trials of 2 flips each. <strong>NB</strong>: “mean” is often used as
shorthand for the arithmetic mean.</p>
<p>Now we’re starting to see the 0.5 probability (i.e., one head out of
two flips) stabilize! Remember, we know the answer is 0.5 because we set
it as such; 0.5 can be thought of as the population parameter (i.e.,
probability of flipping heads) that we’re trying to estimate from the
sample.</p>
<p>Now let’s go crazy and set the number of trials to 10,000. If you
make a histogram of your results, this is the <strong><em>sampling
distribution</em></strong> of number of heads obtained with two coin
flips (more on sampling distributions in <em>Frequentism using
measurements</em>). That is, this is a distribution of our statistic of
interest (i.e., number of heads out of two flips), where each data point
is a trial/replicate drawn from the statistical population. The mean of
this sampling distribution will be extremely close to the true
population mean (i.e., one head out of two flips: 0.5 probability),
given the large number of trials. Go ahead and calculate the mean of the
sampling distribution and see what you get.</p>
<p>Instead of replicating two coin flips many times, we can also just
flip many, many coins in one replicate. Flip a coin 10,000 times by
entering <code>rbinom(1, 10000, 0.5)</code> and calculate the mean. The
observed proportion of heads (# heads divided by 10,000) should be very
close to 0.5. <a
href="https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html#section1">This
same concept is illustrated at this nifty interactive site</a>.</p>
<p>FYI, if you want to create the figure from my lecture, you need to
know how to write a <code>for()</code> loop, which you will learn how to
do shortly. In the meantime, here is the code (the plot won’t look
exactly the same as in lecture, especially with smaller numbers of
flips, due to the stochasticity involved in flipping coins):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prop_heads &lt;- array(dim = 10000)

for(i in 1:length(prop_heads)){
  
  prop_heads[i] &lt;- rbinom(1, i, prob = 0.5)
}

plot(
  1:length(prop_heads), 
  prop_heads / 1:length(prop_heads), 
  type = &quot;l&quot;, 
  log = &quot;x&quot;, 
  xlab = &quot;Number of coin flips&quot;, 
  ylab = &quot;Proportion that are heads&quot;
  )

abline(h = 0.5, col = &quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><a
href="https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html#section2">Here
is another interactive activity from that same website that illustrates
the same concept but with dice rolls</a>.</p>
<p>What you have just simulated and worked through is the
<strong><em>law of large numbers</em></strong>: with a large sample size
and/or many replicates, the mean will be an accurate estimate of the
population mean.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-frequentism-using-measurements" class="section level2">
<h2>Frequentism using measurements</h2>
<p>We will stick to the example in lecture, where we’re interested in
the average height of all adults on Earth (i.e., our statistical
population). Clearly, it’s not possible to measure the height of
<em>every single</em> individual, so we make some inference about the
statistical population using samples drawn from it.</p>
<p>Our statistical population will be a normal distribution of heights
with <code>mean = 5.5</code> and <code>sd = 0.3</code>. Instead of
plotting a histogram/density plot with an enormous sample size to
accurately approximate a normal distribution, I just plotted the
probability density function of the normal distribution. This can be
done with the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- seq(4, 7, length.out = 1000)

plot(
  x, 
  dnorm(
    x, 
    mean = 5.5, 
    sd = 0.3
    ), 
  type = &quot;l&quot;,

<p>Let’s take a random sample of 10 individuals from this population,
using <code>rnorm(n = 10, mean = 5.5, sd = 0.3)</code>. What is the mean
of this sample’s heights? Perhaps close to the true population mean of
5.5 but probably different. Try the same exact code again, and see how
the mean differs due to variation in the underlying population and the
stochasticity involved in sampling. <strong>NB</strong>: If you wanted
to make sure you randomly drew the same numbers every time, you can do
so by using <code>set.seed()</code> and setting it to a fixed number,
e.g., <code>set.seed(100)</code>. This is useful when publishing code,
so your results are 100% replicable.</p>
<p>If your sample size is huge (e.g., 10,000 individuals), the mean of
your sample will be very close to the population mean. Give that a try
above.</p>
<p>As with the coin flip example, let’s construct a sampling
distribution of means and see what that looks like. But to do so, we
need to first learn how to write a <code>for()</code> loop.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-writing-for-loops" class="section level2">
<h2>Writing <code>for()</code> loops</h2>
<p><code>for()</code> loops lie at the heart of simulations in R. They
are a way to iterate something multiple times to explore the underlying
variation in the process you’re studying (e.g., sampling distribution of
means drawn from a population). They can also be intimidating, but I
will walk you through how they work.</p>
<p>Again, you use a <code>for()</code> loop if you want to
iterate/repeat something many, many times. They first start with the
<code>for()</code> function, within which are the numbers you want to
iterate through, assigned to some object name (usually <code>i</code>).
The <code>for()</code> function is followed by curly braces,
<code>{}</code>, within which is the code you want to iterate multiple
times. Let’s go through a simple example together to make things
clearer.</p>
<p>Let’s start with something silly. Let’s say I wanted to print the
numbers 1 through 10. We will write a <code>for()</code> loop to do
this.</p>
<p>The proper code is this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for(i in 1:10){
  
  print(i)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1
## [1] 2
## [1] 3
## [1] 4
## [1] 5
## [1] 6
## [1] 7
## [1] 8
## [1] 9
## [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>What is going on here? Let’s see what the <code>for()</code> loop is
doing step by step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <code>i in 1:10</code> within <code>for()</code> is telling R
to conduct 10 iterations, where <code>i</code> is first <code>1</code>,
then <code>2</code>, and so on and so forth until <code>i = 10</code>.
So, <code>i = 1</code> during the first iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we enter the curly braces. I like to think of curly braces as
the repeat signs in sheet music. So with <code>i = 1</code>, we enter
the opening curly brace and approach <code>print(i)</code>, which is
telling R to print <code>i</code>, i.e., <code>1</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z41zRRmGL8U/maxresdefault.jpg"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We then hit the closed curly brace, which tells us the iteration
where <code>i = 1</code> is over. We now go back to the opening curly
brace (i.e., Step 2), but now <code>i = 2</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We loop through Steps 2 and 3 with <code>i</code> increasing by
<code>1</code> every time until we reach the end, i.e., when
<code>i = 10</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think will happen if you enter:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for(i in c(1, 3, 5)){
  
  print(i)
}</code></pre>
<p>What about:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for(i in 1:10){
  
  print(i * 2)
}</code></pre>
<p>Test out your predictions below.</p>

</div>
<p>More commonly, <code>for()</code> loops are used to iterate through
something and then save the results. For example,
<code>rbinom(10, 2, 0.5)</code> returns a vector, where each of the 10
elements is the number of heads out of two coin flips. We can actually
do the same thing with a <code>for()</code> loop where each iteration is
one set of two coin flips (though using <code>rbinom(10, 2, 0.5)</code>
is far easier).</p>
<p>To do this, we have to first create an empty vector to save our 10
results to. This is common practice in <code>for()</code> loops. We then
iterate through numbers 1 through 10, each time flipping two coins,
i.e., <code>rbinom(1, 2, 0.5)</code>, and then save the results to the
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th element of the empty
vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># empty vector of length 10 called rbinom10
rbinom10 &lt;- array(dim = 10) 

# iterating through 1 to 10, with each number assigned to i each time. 
# Even better to soft code and type length(rbinom10) instead of 10
for(i in 1:10){ 

  # for each iteration where i = 1, 2, 3, ...10, generate number of heads from two coin flips and save the result to the ith empty element in rbinom10
  rbinom10[i] &lt;- rbinom(1, 2, 0.5) 
}</code></pre>
<p>Try out the code above.</p>
<p>We will practice <code>for()</code> loops with the following
exercises.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exercise-1-for-loops" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 1: for() loops</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Similar to the previous <code>rbinom()</code> <code>for()</code>
loop, create a vector of 10 elements called <code>rnorm10</code>, where
each element is the <em>mean</em> of 100 observations drawn from a
normal distribution with <code>mean = 0</code> and <code>sd = 1</code>.
<em>Hint</em>: you want to use <code>rnorm()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a vector of numbers
<code>x &lt;- c(10, 8, 14, 22, 32)</code>, and use a <code>for()</code>
loop to iterate through log-transforming each element. Save the
log-transformed elements to a new vector called <code>log_x</code>. You
can check your answers against <code>log(x)</code>, which accomplishes
the same thing.</p></li>

<p>Remember, the sampling distribution is defined as the distribution of
a <em>statistic</em> (e.g., mean, median), obtained from a large number
of samples drawn from the population. It is <em>NOT</em> a distribution
of the observations in your sample. In a sampling distribution, each
data point is a mean (or some other statistic), calculated from a sample
obtained from the statistical population. Each data point in a
distribution of observations from a sample is just that: an observation;
to plot this, you would enter
<code>hist(rnorm(100, mean = 5.5, sd = 0.3))</code> to get a sample of
100 observations from the statistical population. Do this and compare it
to the histogram of the sampling distribution of means. The latter has
smaller spread because the data points are means, each of which is
distilling its respective original distribution of observations into its

class="section level3">
<h3>Sampling distribution of means from a non-normal distribution</h3>
<p>Let’s repeat the previous sampling distribution of means exercise,
but this time we’ll use a non-normal distribution for the statistical
population: the lognormal with <code>meanlog = 1.5</code> and
<code>sdlog = 0.5</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s first create a plot of the statistical population to see what
its distribution looks like. I’ve done so for you using the code
below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- seq(0, 40, length.out = 1000)

plot(
  x, 
  dlnorm(
    x, 
    meanlog = 1.5, 
    sdlog = 0.5
    ), 
  xlab = &quot;&quot;, 
  ylab = &quot;Density&quot;,
  type = &quot;l&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="Week4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>You can see the population distribution is not normal.</p>
<p>To create the sampling distribution of means, you can reuse your
<code>for()</code> loop code above, this time replacing
<code>rnorm()</code> with <code>rlnorm()</code>, <code>mean = 5.5</code>
with <code>meanlog = 1.5</code>, and <code>sd = 0.3</code> with
<code>sdlog = 0.5</code>. Call the vector a new name if you’d like. Make
a histogram of your results. What does the distribution look like?</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="CLT" data-caption="Code"

</div>
<p>It’s normal! This is the <strong><em>central limit
theorem</em></strong> (CLT): no matter the shape of the underlying
population distribution, the sampling distribution of means (or sums)
will be normally distributed with a large enough sample size (in our
case, we used 100). The link above is a good illustration of the CLT,
and you can test it out on all kinds of population distribution
shapes.</p>
<p>The CLT is incredibly important in statistics as many procedures
require a normally distributed sampling distribution (e.g., confidence
intervals, t-tests).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-standard-error" class="section level2">
<h2>Standard error</h2>
<p>The mean of a sampling distribution provides us with an estimate of a
population parameter (e.g., population mean). To characterize the
variability (i.e., uncertainty) surrounding our estimate, we calculate
<strong><em>standard errors</em></strong> and <strong><em>confidence
intervals</em></strong>.</p>
<p>If the mean of a sampling distribution provides us with an estimate
of the population parameter, then a natural measure of variability
surrounding that estimate might be the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution. In fact, this is exactly what a standard error
is: the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Note that we
can use the mean and SD because the CLT guarantees our sampling
distribution of a mean or sum parameter will be normal!</p>
<p>Let’s look at the sampling distribution of means we created earlier
(i.e., <code>norm_samp_dist</code>). Here is the code again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>norm_samp_dist &lt;- array(dim = 1000)

for(i in 1:length(norm_samp_dist)){
  
  norm_samp_dist[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(100, mean = 5.5, sd = 0.3))
} </code></pre>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="se" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"

<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Now calculate the standard error by calculating the standard
deviation of <code>norm_samp_dist</code>. The standard error provides a
measure of uncertainty surrounding our population parameter
estimate.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> The standard error is <em>NOT</em> the standard
deviation, even though the two are often confused for each other. The
standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution,
and the standard deviation is the standard deviation of a sample of
observations. Thus, the distinction between standard error and standard
deviation is pretty much the same as the distinction between a sampling
distribution and one sample of observations. As mentioned earlier, the
sampling distribution has less spread than a sample of observations.
Therefore, the standard error will always be smaller than the standard
deviation.</p>
<div id="section-standard-error-as-calculated-from-an-equation"
class="section level3">
<h3>Standard error as calculated from an equation</h3>
<p>Most times in research, we have no idea what the sampling
distribution of a statistic looks like because we do not have multiple
sample replicates from a population. Luckily, very smart statisticians
were able to come up with formulas to infer properties of the sampling
distribution from one sample/replicate only.</p>
<p>The formula for standard error is <span class="math inline">\(s /
\sqrt{n}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the
standard deviation of the sample, and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. This formula
emphasizes that (1) standard error and standard deviation are not the
same thing and (2) the standard error is always smaller than the
standard deviation because <span class="math inline">\(n &gt;
1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s generate one random sample of 100 observations from our
normally distributed population with <code>mean = 5.5</code> and
<code>sd = 0.3</code> (hopefully you know how to do this by now).
Calculate the standard error using the equation above and compare it to
the standard error value you calculated earlier (by calculating SD on
the sampling distribution).</p>

<div id="section-confidence-intervals" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence intervals</h2>
<p>Confidence intervals are defined as a “range of plausible values for
an unknown parameter” (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">from
Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>In most scientific fields, we use a significance level (<span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) of 0.05, which means we will
falsely reject a hypothesis 5% of the time if it’s true. What this means
will become clearer when we go over the behavior of confidence intervals
and P-values.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> translates to 95%
confidence intervals, which are the middle 95% of a sampling
distribution. Let’s again use our sampling distribution of means from
before:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>norm_samp_dist &lt;- array(dim = 1000)

for(i in 1:length(norm_samp_dist)){
  
  norm_samp_dist[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(100, mean = 5.5, sd = 0.3))

<pre class="text"><code># get sample from population

# calculate 95% CI
c(mean(x) - 1.96 * se.x, 
  mean(x) + 1.96 * se.x)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The middle 95% can be obtained using
<code>quantile(norm_samp_dist, c(0.025, 0.975))</code>, which returns
the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles (can you reason out why we use these
numbers?). Go ahead and try out the code above.</p>
<div id="section-calculating-confidence-intervals-using-a-formula"
class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating confidence intervals using a formula</h3>
<p>Again, we use formulas whenever we have only one sample/replicate and
have no idea what the sampling distribution looks like. To calculate 95%
CI in this manner:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Calculate the standard error, which you know how to do from the
previous topic.</li>
<li>The lower confidence limit equals the sample mean minus 1.96 times
the standard error.</li>
<li>The upper confidence limit equals the sample mean plus 1.96 times
the standard error.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why 1.96? Remember the 68-95-99.7 rule, where +/- two standard
deviations equals the central 95% of a normal distribution. More
precisely, it’s 1.96, not 2.00.</p>
<p><img
src="https://sophialearning.s3.amazonaws.com/markup_pictures/9562/68-95-99.7.png"
style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>Try this out on a random sample of 100 observations from the
population (<code>mean = 5.5, sd = 0.3</code>). Compare the resulting
95% CI with that obtained using the <code>quantile()</code> function on
the sampling distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-hypothesis-tests-using-confidence-intervals"
class="section level3">
<h3>Hypothesis tests using confidence intervals</h3>
<p>Recalling that confidence intervals are calculated for a parameter
estimate (in this case, the population mean), we can use them to test
hypotheses about the population parameter. For example, if we wanted to
know if the population mean of our human heights is significantly
different from 6 feet, we would see if 6 feet falls outside our
calculated 95% CI. If so, 6 feet would be an unlikely value, given our
sampling distribution (you can see how likely 6 feet is in the
<code>norm_samp_dist</code> sampling distribution by creating a
histogram). Therefore, we conclude that our population mean is
significantly different from 6 feet.</p>
<p>If 6 feet falls within the 95% confidence interval, this <em>DOES
NOT</em> mean that the population mean is 6 feet. This will become
clearer when we go over how sample size affects 95% confidence
intervals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-bootstrapping" class="section level2">
<h2>Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>These days with fast computing, we can use <strong><em>Monte Carlo
methods</em></strong> to “brute force” create the sampling distribution
of a statistic from the sample itself.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is a class of methods that uses repeated random sampling
to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo is the name of the famous
gambling resort city on the Riviera.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*DfT4vHYNWrtxFAp7lendWg.png"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>So how do we create a sampling distribution from the sample? We need
to resample our observations <em>with replacement</em> using the
<code>sample()</code> function.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this function works with a simple example first. Enter
<code>sample(1:5, replace = TRUE)</code> below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="resample" data-caption="Code"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Notice that each element is a random sample from the <code>1:5</code>
vector. You sometimes get repeated elements (keep entering the code
until you see this) because after an element is randomly selected from
<code>1:5</code>, the element is replaced so it can potentially be
sampled again. This is what we mean by “sampling with replacement”, and
it is achieved with the argument <code>replace = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>Why does resampling a vector with replacement create a sampling
distribution? First recall that each data point in a sampling
distribution is a statistic (e.g., mean) calculated on <em>one</em>
sample from the population. Each resampling iteration during
bootstrapping represents a different sample drawn from the population.
This works because the original, observed sample is a random,
representative draw from the population. Therefore during bootstrapping,
we treat our observed sample as a proxy for the population. The
resampling with replacement from the oberved sample imitates multiple
samples drawn from the population. Of course, the larger your sample is,
the more likely it will match the population distribution and the more
accurate your sampling distribution will be.</p>
<p>After each resampling iteration, you calculate your statistic of
interest and save the result. You repeat this step many, many times (at
least 1000x) to get a sampling distribution for the statistic of
interest.</p>
<p>The great thing about bootstrapping is that you can create a sampling
distribution for <em>any</em> statistic you want. This includes
statistics for which there are no good theories or formulas for
calculating standard error (e.g., the median). As a result, you can
create confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests using virtually
any statistic you can think of (as long as it can be calculated on your
sample). Hopefully, you can now see how powerful and useful
bootstrapping is!</p>
<div id="section-bootstrapping-in-action" class="section level3">
<h3>Bootstrapping in action</h3>
<p>Let’s once again create a random sample of 100 normally distributed
observations from our population (<code>mean = 5.5, sd = 0.3</code>). I
will present each coding step involved in bootstrapping the sampling
distribution for the population mean.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an empty vector of length 1,000 since we will do 1,000
bootstrap iterations (feel free to do more if your computer is fast
enough!).</li>
<li>Initiate a <code>for()</code> loop, where <code>i</code> goes from
<code>1</code> to the length of the empty vector.</li>
<li>Within the curly braces, resample with replacement the vector of 100

<li>Calculate the mean of the object, and save the result to the <span

<h2>Confidence intervals and the true parameter value</h2>
<p>It is often thought that a single 95% CI represents the range of
values where there’s a 95% chance the true parameter value is inside.
This interpretation is <em>NOT</em> correct. In frequentist statistics,
the parameter value is fixed, and the confidence intervals move around
due to the stochastic nature of drawing samples from the population (in
Bayesian inference, it’s the complete opposite: the sample is fixed and
the parameter is treated as random!). Therefore, for each iteration of a
CI, it either captures the true parameter value or misses it. Given the
preset significance threshold of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha =
0.05\)</span>, 5% of confidence intervals will miss the parameter value
on average.</p>
<p>Let’s conduct some simulations to see all this in action.</p>
<p>We will recreate the figure from my lecture, keeping in mind that the
CI won’t look exactly the same due to the stochasticity involved in
sampling from a population. What we want to do is calculate 50 CI for
the mean of a normally distributed population that has
<code>mean = 0, sd = 1</code> (i.e., the default <code>rnorm()</code>
arguments). With 50 CI, on average 2.5 will miss the true mean (i.e.,
0), so we’re expecting 2 or 3 CI to miss (though you might get 4 or
none!).</p>
<p>I will tell you how to code this step by step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an empty array, called <code>ci.res</code>, with 50 rows and

<h2>Confidence intervals and sample size</h2>
<p>Confidence intervals shrink as sample size increases because the law
of large numbers tells us that sample means are estimated more precisely
with larger sample sizes. That is, each mean in the sampling
distribution will be pretty close to the true population mean, such that
the spread of the sampling distribution will be small (which causes CI
to be small).</p>
<p>We will explore this behavior through simulations by again recreating
a figure from my lecture (again, realizing that the CI won’t look
<em>exactly</em> the same). We will create CI using samples of different
sizes that are drawn from a normal distribution with
<code>mean = 0, sd = 1</code>. Again, I will walk you through the code

<li>Now create an empty array that has <code>length(n)</code> rows and

<p>So, the takeaway here is that as sample size increases, the CI will
shrink around the true value. As a result, you can be pretty confident
that you know what the true parameter value is, which is great if you
want to use the data to corroborate some predicted value from a
hypothesis. It also means that your CI will pretty much exclude every
value except the parameter, such that the estimated mean will be
significantly different from all other values. Lastly, this exercise
emphasizes how a value capture by the CI does not mean it’s the true
parameter value: the shrinking of CI with larger sample size almost
guarantees that that value will be excluded.</p>

<h2>P-values</h2>
<p>P-values are some of the most emphasized statistics in research,
often used to determine whether an effect is “real” or not. This is not
entirely accurate, and we will see why with simulations.</p>
<p>P-values are defined as the probability of obtaining the observed
data or more extreme, <em>assuming</em> a hypothesis is true. The
hypothesis in question is usually the null hypothesis (e.g., effect is
0, group difference is 0). This is because zero effects are easy to work
with, since we know what the true parameter value is: zero. But, the
null hypothesis is also often the least interesting hypothesis, as
nothing is truly zero in biology or anthropology. This means we know
that the null hypothesis will be falsified even before we conduct the
test; we just need a large enough sample size. We’ll see how this works
in <em>P-values and sample size</em>.</p>

<p>Now, we will use bootstrapping to calculate a P-value, testing the
null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of both
groups’ populations (as if both groups sample the same population). That
is, the observed mean difference we see in our samples is simply due to
chance sampling from a single population. Bootstrapping is perhaps the
clearest way to really understand what a P-value is, as you have to code
all the steps involved.</p>
<div id="section-recipe-for-a-null-hypothesis-test"

<h3>Recipe for a null hypothesis test</h3>
<p>From the lecture, the steps are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pick a test statistic.</li>
<li>Assume the null hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>Create the null sampling distribution of the test statistic,

</ol>
<div id="section-step-1-pick-a-test-statistic" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1 (pick a test statistic)</h4>
<p>Because we want to see if the two groups’ means differ, the
difference in means (i.e., mean difference) seems to be the natural
choice.</p>

<h4>Step 3 (Create the null sampling distribution of test statistic,

<p>Recall that with bootstrapping, we use our sample as a proxy to
represent the population. So if both of our samples come from the same
population (assuming the null hypothesis is true), what would the
population proxy look like? Because <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
sample the same population, we just combine them into one vector, thus
representing one population! You can create a histogram of
<code>c(x, y)</code> to see what the new population distribution looks
like. Also, save <code>c(x, y)</code> to an object, as you’ll need to
resample from this vector later.</p>

<p>Now, we need to use a <code>for()</code> loop and

vector to create new bootstrapped samples of <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>. The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an empty array, whose length is 1,000 (number of bootstrap

<li>Use a <code>for()</code> loop to iterate through <code>1</code> to

<li>Sample from the “population” vector with replacement, so that the
number of elements equals <code>length(x)</code> (this is the second
argument in <code>sample()</code>). This is your new sample of
<code>x</code> (but call it a different object) from the combined null
population distribution.</li>
<li>Do the same for your new sample of <code>y</code>, i.e., use

<h4>Step 4 (Calculate the P-value, i.e., the probability of getting the
observed test statistic or more extreme, given the null
distribution)</h4>
<p>This probability can be determined by counting the number of null
distribution values that are equal to or more extreme than the observed
test statistic. What does “equal to or more extreme” mean? That depends
on whether we want to conduct a two- or one-tailed test.</p>
<p>Whether we calculate a two- or one-tailed P-value depends on our
research question. Two-tailed tests are used if we’re only concerned
with whether the group means are different, not whether one group
specifically has a larger mean than the other. A one-tailed test is used
if we want to test whether the larger group (i.e., <code>x</code>) is
significantly larger on average than the smaller group (i.e.,
<code>y</code>).</p>
<p><img

style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>For either test, we first calculate the observed test statistic
(i.e., the mean difference: <code>mean(x) - mean(y)</code>). Save this
to an object called <code>obs_diff</code>.</p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, we want to count the number of null
distribution values that are greater than or equal to
<code>obs_diff</code> but also less than or equal
to<code>-1 * obs_diff</code>. Why is this? This is because our
bootstrapped iterations randomly assigned heights (with replacement) to
new samples of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, such that sometimes
<code>mean(x)</code> was larger and sometimes <code>mean(y)</code> was
larger (thus, sometimes the mean difference was positive and sometimes
it was negative). Because we’re not concerned with which group is
larger, we need to consider the null distribution values in either side
of the tail (see image above). We then divide this number by the total
number of iterations (i.e., 1,000) to get the proportion of null
distribution values equal to or more extreme than the observed test
statistic.</p>
<p>Go ahead and calculate a two-tailed P-value (<code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> are loaded in the console below, but you’ll have to rerun
the bootstrap code). You can do this by using a logical statement to
count the number of null distribution values that are greater than or
equal to <code>obs_diff</code> or less than or equal to
<code>-1 * obs_diff</code>. Divide this number by 1,000 (the number of
iterations).</p>

<h2>Type I error</h2>
<p>Type I error is falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it is
true. The probability of committing this error is equivalent to the
preset significance level (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>),
which is 0.05 in most scientific fields (i.e., the probability of
committing a Type I error is 5%). We will go over Type II error in the
next topic.</p>

style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Type I error happens because you can get a large effect just by
chance even if there is no effect in the underlying statistical
population. For example, look at the null sampling distribution below
(i.e., the sampling distribution of a test statistic, assuming the null
hypothesis is true). We can see that most values cluster around zero, as
expected, but there are some values that, though rare, are quite large.
If we sample from a distribution enough times, we will eventually sample
the rare values in the tails. You can give this a shot with
<code>rnorm()</code> by comparing <code>max(rnorm(10))</code> with
<code>max(rnorm(10000))</code>, i.e., with a small sample size you will
likely not sample rare large values, but you will with a larger sample
size. This is essentially Murphy’s Law: “Anything that can go wrong will
go wrong”. This is because anything that can happen with a non-zero
probability (even if it’s <em>extremely</em> low) will happen given a
large enough sample size. You can illustrate this with
<code>sum(rbinom(1, 100000, 0.0001))</code>, which is how many times
something with a 0.0001 probability of occurring will happen if given
100,000 opportunities.</p>

that if obtained, means our test is significant. We can see that we will
sample values in the gray regions 5% of the time, even if the null

statistic needs to be to be significant at <span

<p>We can illustrate all this with (surprise, surprise!) simulations.
Let’s calculate 1,000 P-values using a two-tailed t-test, assuming the

the same exact mean). Let’s also save the mean differences associated
with each P-value to see what the large ones with P &lt; 0.05 look like.

extreme tails of the distribution. FYI, the two-tailed critical values

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We don’t know whether the null hypothesis is true or not (after all,
this is why we conduct the statistical test!). If the null hypothesis is
indeed true, we would (unknowingly) find a significant result 5% of the
time. Conduct enough tests, and we will get a significant result (not
good)! That’s why my philosophy is to calculate as few P-values as
possible (more on this in a future week).</p>

leads us to our final topic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-p-values-and-sample-size" class="section level2">
<h2>P-values and sample size</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in lecture, three things affect P-values. Using the
example of comparing the means of two groups, P-values will go down
if:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Mean difference is larger.</li>
<li>Variation among observations in each sample decreases.</li>
<li>Sample size of each group increases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, these three things act to decrease the overlap between the
sampling distributions of these samples’ means, such that their mean
differences are more obvious. We are going to focus on sample size for
this topic.</p>
<p>As long as an effect is non-zero (even if it is minuscule), a large
enough sample size will generate enough statistical power to return P
&lt; 0.05. This is due to the law of large numbers: a larger sample size
ensures that the sample means of each group are estimated so precisely
that the mean differences between groups will be very obvious, and the
sampling distribution of mean differences will have very narrow spread
(such that a small observed mean difference will fall outside the
sampling distribution and be significant).</p>
<p>You can see how this works by bootstrapping the mean difference
sampling distribution, and seeing how it changes by varying sample size,
while keeping the mean and SD of both groups fixed. But for now, we will
just use simulations to see how P-values vary as a function of sample
size.</p>
<p>This involves writing a <em>nested</em> <code>for()</code> loop, so
we can average multiple P-values for a given sample size to stabilize
the P-value. I will write a function for you that does this.</p>

<p>The function is called <code>pvals_n</code>, and it calculates the
P-value from a t-test comparing the means of two groups. The arguments
are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>n</code>: a vector of sample sizes to calculate P-values
with</li>
<li><code>n.iter</code>: number of iterations to average P-values over.
I did 1,000 but do whatever your computer can handle in a reasonable
amount of time (try not to go lower than 100).</li>
<li><code>mean1</code>: the population mean of Group 1</li>
<li><code>sd1</code>: the population SD of Group 1 (default is 1)</li>
<li><code>mean2</code>: the population mean of Group 2</li>
<li><code>sd2</code>: the population SD of Group 2 (default is 1)</li>
<li><code>PLOT</code>: if <code>TRUE</code> (default), will return a
plot of P-values as a function of sample size. If <code>FALSE</code>,
will return the vector of P-values associated with each sample size
element in vector <code>n</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have loaded the function for you in the console below. Try
<code>n &lt;- c(seq(5, 50, 5), 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000)</code>
for your vector of sample sizes. Let’s start with setting
<code>mean1 = 0</code> and <code>mean2 = 0</code> (i.e., the null
hypothesis is true), using the default for all other arguments.</p>
<p>You can see that P-values do not vary as a function of sample size
when the null hypothesis is true. However, let’s now create a small
difference in means: <code>mean1 = 5</code> and
<code>mean2 = 4.8</code>.</p>
<p>You can see how even a small mean difference will be exploited as
significant if sample size is large enough. Go ahead and play around
with different sample sizes, means, and SDs to see how different
combinations contribute to different P-values.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I made the (untestable) assertion in lecture that no effect (e.g.,
mean difference) is truly ever zero in biology or anthropology.
Therefore, a non-significant result just means your sample size (and
therefore statistical power) is not large enough to detect an effect,
and you <em>WILL</em> get a significant result if you just increase your
sample size enough.</p>
<p>P &gt; 0.05 is also known as a Type II error: failing to reject the
null hypothesis when it is false (again, I think null hypotheses are
<em>always</em> false). To correct this, you just need a larger sample
size.</p>
<p><img

style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Therefore, a P-value is in essence just tracking sample size, and it
is given too much importance in research (in my opinion). The “P” in
P-value stands for probability, but it really should stand for power
(i.e., statistical power). Instead, don’t forget to interpret the
observed mean difference itself! For example, is a mean difference of
0.2 between 5 and 4.8 really that interesting?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This tutorial covered the theoretical foundation for inferential
statistics (i.e., learning something about the statistical population by
analyzing a sample from said population). Instead of going through math
and formulas, I have taught you these concepts through simulations. This
is the strength of R: you can always use simulations to sharpen your
intuition about some statistical concept or method.</p>
<p><img
src="https://biguru.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/introduction-to-statistical-inference.jpg" /></p>
<p>I first introduced the frequentist philosophy of statistics, by far
the most commonly used in statistical analyses. This involves the
unknown (and often abstract and theoretical) statistical population,
from which samples are taken. We often only have one sample, but it is
one out of theoretically many. Calculating a statistic on these
theoretically many samples forms the <strong><em>sampling
distribution</em></strong> of a statistic, which lies at the core of all
inferential statistical tests. We even learned how you can
mathematically approximate the sampling distribution from just one
sample (this was necessary before powerful computers and
bootstrapping)!</p>
<p><img
src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/7-171220000907/95/sampling-distribution-1-638.jpg?cb=1513728698" /></p>
<p>We learned how to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals
from sampling distributions of test statistics to conduct hypothesis
tests. We also learned what P-values are and how they are derived from a
sampling distribution of the test statistic that assumes the null
hypothesis is true. Perhaps most importantly, we explored how confidence
intervals and P-values behave (e.g., with increasing sample size), using
simulations.</p>
<p>In sum, we covered a lot in this tutorial! Again, I don’t expect you
to have understood and memorized everything having only gone through the
tutorial once. Go through it multiple times, and the more you go through
it, the better you will understand these concepts. I also wanted to
plant a seed in your head and give you a general idea of what these
concepts are. As you start conducting research and analyzing data,
hopefully these tutorial topics will pop up in your head, and you’ll
make connections between what you’re doing and their theoretical
underpinnings!
