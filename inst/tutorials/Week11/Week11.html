<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week, we covered two different but related topics: linear mixed
models and autocorrelation. <strong>Linear mixed models</strong> (LMMs)
model a DV as a linear function of <strong>fixed</strong> and
<strong>random factors</strong> (sometimes also called fixed and random
effects, respectively). <strong>Fixed factors</strong> are categorical
variables whose levels are the only ones of interest. Therefore, we
estimate coefficients for the different levels because we are interested
in how the intercept and/or slope of the DV against another IV changes
with each level in our fixed factor. <strong>Random factors</strong> are
categorical variables whose levels are a random, representative sample
of some larger population of levels. Therefore, we are not interested in
estimating coefficients for each level but instead want to infer
something about the population of intercepts/slopes from which our
levels are sampled. A utilitarian perspective can help with determining
whether your factor is fixed or random: do you want to estimate
coefficients for each level (along with P-values and confidence
intervals) or do you want to estimate the SD of the population of
intercepts/slopes from which your levels are sampled? As always, the
distinction depends on your research question!</p>

style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>The second topic we covered was how to measure and deal with
autocorrelation in your analyses. As a reminder,
<strong>autocorrelation</strong> is simply non-independence in your
data, where data points closer in space/time/phylogeny are more similar.
Autocorrelation is somewhat related to LMMs because one can specify
blocking factors as random factors to account for autocorrelation in
LMMs. What we specifically covered was how to isolate the autocorrelated
noise component in one’s data through detrending. We also covered how to
measure autocorrelation in the data using correlograms. Lastly, we went
over how to measure the association between two variables in time and
space using cross-correlograms and generalized least squares.</p>

style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will cover how to do all of the above in R.
Where necessary, we will do some simple simulations to really make clear
how some of these methods and concepts work. At the end of the tutorial,
you should be able to run basic LMMs and know how to handle
autocorrelation in your own research.</p>

<h2>Random factors</h2>
<p>I briefly defined random factors in the <em>Introduction</em>, and I
taught when to use them and how they’re used in lecture. In this
tutorial, we will learn about random factors via another avenue:
simulations.</p>
<div id="section-random-intercept-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Random intercept model</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in the <em>Introduction</em>, one specifies a factor
as random if one is interested in estimating the SD of the population of
intercepts or slopes from which the levels are sampled. Let’s see how
this works by first simulating data and then estimating the population
SD of the intercepts across levels using LMMs.</p>
<p>One can think of a random factor as an extra term added to the
intercept:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \alpha + \beta_1 X + \epsilon,
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \sim N(0, \tau)\)</span>.
That is, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a random factor
that is normally distributed with mean zero and SD equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. So each level within a random
factor is associated with a number drawn from this normal distribution
that tells us by how much that level’s intercept deviates from the main
estimated intercept (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, a
fixed effect). This SD (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>) is
the parameter estimated in a LMM, and hopefully you can now see why
levels from a random factor are associated with some population, whose
SD (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>) we want to estimate.</p>
<p>Below is the code to simulate the data, with comments on what each
line is doing (code adapted from <a
href="https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/random_intercepts.html">here</a>).
After you get somewhat of a handle of what’s going on, copy and paste
the code into the console below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>intercept_SD &lt;- 0.5 # setting SD of population of intercept deviations
e_SD &lt;- 0.25 # setting SD of population of error terms

set.seed(1234) # to make simulations replicable
Nlevels &lt;- 100 # number of levels within the random factor
NperLevel &lt;- 5 # number of observations per level
N &lt;- Nlevels * NperLevel # total number of observations

e &lt;- rnorm(N, sd = e_SD) # simulate error terms
x &lt;- runif(N) # simulate IV
y &lt;- 2 + .5 * x + a[Levels] + e # simulate DV, fixed intercept (2), fixed slope (0.5), add random factor, and add error terms

<pre class="text"><code>lmm.res &lt;- lme(y ~ x, random = ~1|Levels, data = d)

summary(lmm.res)

ranef(lmm.res)

hist(ranef(lmm.res)[, 1])

mean(ranef(lmm.res)[, 1])
sd(ranef(lmm.res)[, 1])</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now fit a LMM to the data. This is done using <code>lme()</code> from
the <code>nlme</code> package. The proper line of code is
<code>lmm.res &lt;- lme(y ~ x, random = ~1|Levels, data = d)</code>. The
<code>random = ~1|Levels</code> tells R that we want to estimate the SD
of intercepts (<code>~1</code>) across levels within the factor
<code>Levels</code>. Enter the code above.</p>
<p>Now enter <code>summary(lmm.res)</code> to see the full suite of
results. First you’ll see that the estimated SD for the intercept is
0.5, precisely what we set the population SD to be. The Residual SD is
0.24, close to the 0.25 we specified. The intercept and slope are 1.9
and 0.53, close to the values we picked. And lastly, you can see that
the fixed effects (intercept and slope) are significant; we can get
P-values for simple LMMs like this one but not for more complicated LMMs
(which can’t be run using <code>lme()</code>).</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> A P-value can be vanishingly small but can never
be zero. Zero in this case is synonymous with a very, very, very small
number.</p>
<p>We can also get out the deviations (from the main intercept) for each
observed level sampled from the population. This is done with
<code>ranef(lmm.res)</code>, which returns the result as a data frame
(this is also how you plot each level’s fitted lines on a scatter plot).
Enter <code>hist(ranef(lmm.res)[, 1])</code> to see the distribution
sampled from the population. Because we have 100 levels, a sizable
sample size, the mean and SD of <code>ranef(lmm.res)[, 1]</code> should
be very close to the population mean and SD (0 and 0.5,
respectively).</p>

<h3>Random intercept and slope model</h3>
<p>To finish out this section, we will simulate another set of data,
this time for a random intercept <em>and</em> slope model. This equation
is now:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \alpha_0 + (\beta_1 + \alpha_1) X + \epsilon,

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_0 \sim N(0, \tau_0)\)</span>

class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> is a random factor that is
normally distributed with mean zero and SD equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> is the population of each
level’s deviation from the fixed slope effect, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Below is the proper code with comments. Review it and then copy and
paste it into the console below.</p>

</div>
<p>Fit the LMM with
<code>lmm.res1 &lt;- lme(y ~ x, random = ~x | Levels, data = d)</code>.
The <code>random = ~x | Levels</code> tells R that we want to estimate
the SD of deviations for the slope across the factor <code>Levels</code>
(the intercept is implied, just like it is when you use
<code>lm()</code>).</p>
<p>Compare the estimated parameters with those you specified (i.e., main
intercept, main slope, intercept SD, slope SD, and residual SD).</p>
<p>As before, you can get out each level’s deviations for the intercept
and slope using <code>ranef()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> I don’t go over how to do this, but you can fit
<em>generalized linear mixed models</em> using <code>glmer()</code> in
the <code>lme4</code> package. There is just one extra argument,
<code>family =</code>, which you use to specify the error distribution
(e.g., <code>family = "binomial"</code> would fit a logistic regression
mixed model).</p>

<div id="section-comparing-ancova-and-lmm" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparing ANCOVA and LMM</h2>
<p>Comparing the goals and results of ANCOVA to LMM will also make
clearer when one would make a factor random rather than fixed.</p>
<p>For this section, we will use the <code>sleepstudy</code> dataset in
the <code>lme4</code> package. Enter <code>?sleepstudy</code> to get an
idea of what the dataset and variables therein are.</p>
<p>Let’s fit an ANCOVA with an interaction term to see see how the
intercept and slope of <code>Reaction ~ Days</code> change as a function
of the levels within <code>Subject</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ancova" data-completion="1"

lmm.res &lt;- lme(Reaction ~ Days, random = ~Days | Subject, data = sleepstudy)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, a total of 36 coefficients were estimated, two for
each subject (intercept and slope)! This would be fine if the subjects
were of interest for whatever reason, and we wanted to know what their
estimated intercepts and slopes were. But, we have 180 data points only,
which means we have 5 data points per estimated coefficient (we are
definitely overfitting the data!).</p>
<p>A LMM, on the other hand, would estimate only two fixed effects
(intercept and slope) and two other parameters (one SD each for the
populations of intercept and slope deviations). Go ahead and fit the
LMM.</p>
<div id="section-shrinkageregularization" class="section level3">
<h3>Shrinkage/regularization</h3>
<p>At this point, feel free to compare the estimated slope and intercept
for each level for an ANCOVA vs. a LMM (you can do this for a few
subjects; I present code for doing this for all subjects in “Solution”).
Remember that each level’s intercept in an ANCOVA is obtained by adding
the baseline intercept to that level’s main effect (e.g., to get the
intercept for <code>Subject309</code>, add the main intercept,
<code>244.193</code>, with the coefficient <code>Subject309</code>,
<code>-39.138</code>). To get the level’s slope, add the baseline slope
to that subject’s interaction term (e.g., to get the slope for
<code>Subject309</code>, add <code>21.765</code> with
<code>-19.503</code>). To get a level’s intercept and slope from a LMM,
you just add the deviation to its respective fixed effect
(<code>Subject309</code>’s intercept is the fixed intercept effect,
<code>251.405</code>, plus the intercept deviation,
<code>-40.398</code>). Recall that you extract the deviations using
<code>ranef(lmm.res)</code> (though I present another way of extracting
deviations in “Solution”).</p>

</div>
<p>As you’ll see, the LMM’s intercept and slope will be closer to their
fixed counterparts (i.e., their averages) than those from ANCOVA; recall
that the LMM’s fixed effects are the same as the intercept and slope for
a linear model fit without <code>Subject</code> as a random factor. This
phenomenon is know as <strong>shrinkage</strong>,
<strong>regularization</strong>, or <strong>partial pooling</strong>.
Because each level’s intercept deviation, for example, is sampled from a
population with mean 0, levels’ intercepts are expected to be close to
zero on average. Therefore, each level’s deviation will be pulled
towards zero (i.e., each level’s intercept will be pulled towards the
fixed intercept effect). If a level has few observations, its deviations
will be pulled more towards zero (i.e., with little data, the best guess
we can make is the average). Because of this shrinkage property, some
researchers argue that one should <em>always</em> use a LMM as opposed
to an ANCOVA, but this debate is beyond my pay grade.</p>

<h3>A note on blocking</h3>
<p>Multiple measurements were taken on each subject over time. This is
known as a <strong>repeated measures design</strong>. Because of this,
each subject’s measurements are not independent. By including
<code>Subject</code> as a random factor, however, we have effectively
used this variable as a blocking factor. This accounts for the
non-independent data for each subject. Fitting an ANCOVA does the same
thing, but that’s inappropriate here because we don’t have a large
enough sample size to match the large number of estimated
coefficients.</p>

<div id="section-variance-partitioning" class="section level2">
<h2>Variance partitioning</h2>
<p>When one has multiple random factors within a LMM, one can do
<strong>variance partitioning</strong> and see how much DV variation

factor. Perhaps more commonly, one can fit an intercept-only LMM and see
how the DV variation is partitioned among the random factors.</p>

<h3>Crossed random factors</h3>
<p>Random factors are <strong>crossed</strong> if each level within a

penicillin samples (<code>sample</code>). Let’s fit an intercept-only
LMM to quantify how much <code>diameter</code> variation is attributed
to each random factor (i.e., <code>plate</code> and
<code>sample</code>).</p>
<p>Fitting a LMM with crossed random factors is difficult to do with
<code>lme()</code>. This is where LMMs start to become complicated, and
we have to switch to the <code>lmer()</code> function in the
<code>lme4</code> package. To fit a LMM with crossed random factors
using <code>lmer()</code>, enter
<code>lmer(diameter ~ 1 + (1 | plate) + (1 | sample), data = Penicillin)</code>.
The <code>(1 | plate) + (1 | sample)</code> is telling R that we want
our intercept to vary across <code>plate</code> levels and
<code>sample</code> levels.</p>
<p>The main difference using <code>lmer()</code> is that no P-values are
returned. This is not an accident, as P-values cannot be estimated
accurately with complex LMMs (i.e., it is not clear how many degrees of
freedom there are).</p>
<p>We now need to get out the variances. This is done using
<code>VarCorr()</code>, but the output is a bit annoying to work with. I
find it’s easier to transform the output using
<code>as.data.frame()</code>, so enter
<code>as.data.frame(VarCorr(lmm.res))</code>. The column we want is
<code>vcov</code>. You can now interpret those variances as is, but I
find it’s more useful to transform them into proportion variance
explained by dividing each element in the column by the column’s sum. As
we can see, the majority of the <code>diameter</code> variance is
explained by <code>sample</code>, matching our intuition from the dot
plot.</p>

<h3>Nested random factors</h3>
<p><strong>Nested random factors</strong> are those whose factors are
nested within each other (like Russian nesting dolls). Examples include
species nested within genera, hospitals nested within cities nested
within states, etc.</p>

style="width:40.0%" /></p>
<p>For this section, we will use the <code>Pastes</code> dataset from
the <code>lme4</code> package. See the help file for a description of
the dataset.</p>
<p>There are a total of 10 batches (<code>batch</code>), three casks
(<code>cask</code>) per batch, and researchers tested the paste strength
(<code>strength</code>) of two samples (<code>sample</code>) per
cask.</p>
<p>Here is a summary plot of the data (which I pulled from a paper, so
no code):</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/andrewdu1/ANTH674/blob/master/Datasets/Pastes%20summary%20plot.jpg?raw=true"
style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>As you can see from the dataset and the figure, levels from
<code>sample</code> are a combination of <code>batch</code> and
<code>cask</code>. This is necessary so that we know, for example, that
samples of <code>A:a</code> are associated with cask <code>a</code> from
batch <code>A</code>, as opposed to batch <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>A nested random factors LMM is fit using the same exact code as with
crossed factors:
<code>lmer(strength ~ 1 + (1 | sample) + (1 | batch), data = Pastes)</code>.
This emphasizes how random factors’ variances are calculated in the same
exact way, regardless of whether the factors are crossed or nested. You
can also do nested random factors using <code>lme()</code>:
<code>lme(strength ~ 1, random = ~1 | batch / sample, data = Pastes)</code>.
The <code>/</code> indicates that <code>sample</code> is nested within
<code>batch</code> (this symbol also works for <code>lmer()</code>,
e.g.,
<code>lmer(strength ~ 1 + (1 | batch / sample), data = Pastes)</code>).</p>

also set argument <code>scale = TRUE</code> to get out proportion

<p>Time series, like spatial data, are made up of three additive

<div id="section-simulations" class="section level3">
<h3>Simulations</h3>
<p>Let’s simulate a time series with 100 data points. Independent noise
(i.e., <strong>white noise</strong>) is just uncorrelated errors sampled
from a normal distribution with <code>mean = 0</code> and
<code>sd =</code> whichever number you’d like. Use <code>rnorm()</code>
to do this. We will simulate autocorrelated noise (i.e., <strong>red
noise</strong>) with <code>arima.sim(list(ar1 = 0.8), n = 100)</code>,
where 0.8 is the strength of autocorrelation when lag = 1 (pick
whichever numbers you want). And lastly, the trend is just a linear
model with no noise with some intercept and slope values (the
independent variable is <code>1:n</code>). You can plot each component
with <code>plot(time_series_object, type = "l")</code>. To combine the
components for the full time series, just add the three components
together!</p>

<h2>Detrending a time series &amp; correlograms</h2>
<p>We will analyze your simulated, combined time series from the
previous topic (copy and paste your code below! Or you can just use my
code, which I’ve put in the console). This time series is strongly
trended because we simulated it to have a trend. Let’s remove the trend
(i.e., <strong>detrend</strong> the time series), so we’re left with
only autocorrelated and independent noise (the sum of which should still
have autocorrelation).</p>
<p>There are two ways to detrend a time series: (1) first differencing
and (2) fitting a trend and taking the residuals. <strong>First
differencing</strong> is done easily using <code>diff()</code>, though
it should be noted that this method removes both trend and also some
autocorrelation (we’ll see this below). The second method is done by
fitting a trend to the time series and taking residuals (e.g.,
<code>lm(ts_comb ~ c(1:100))$residuals)</code>. If the trend is more
complicated (e.g., non-linear), we can fit a loess curve (using
<code>loess.smooth()</code>) and then take residuals.</p>
<p>Try out both methods of detrending on your simulated time series
below.</p>

<div id="section-autocorrelation-function" class="section level3">
<h3>Autocorrelation function</h3>
<p>The <strong>autocorrelation function</strong> (ACF) is a type of
correlogram where correlations are calculated for a time series against
itself at different time lags. Now, let’s get the ACF plot for each
detrended time series to examine the autocorrelated noise structure. To
produce the ACF plot, simply wrap <code>acf()</code> around the
detrended time series. If you save this to an object, you can enter the
object name to bring up the actual ACF values for each time lag.</p>

</div>
<p>Note that first differencing removed the positive autocorrelated
noise structure (in fact it was so aggressive that there is now
<em>negative</em> autocorrelation at lag = 1). Fitting a trend and
taking residuals does not remove autocorrelation (unlike first
differencing), so we still see (significant) positive autocorrelation up
to lag = 2. Remember that this autocorrelated noise structure is
combined with the independent noise component, so the autocorrelation is
attenuated (compare this ACF to one done on just the autocorrelated
noise component from your simulations).</p>

<h2>Generalized least squares</h2>
<p><strong>Generalized least squares</strong> (GLS) models a DV as a
linear function of one or more IVs, while relaxing the independent
errors assumption of GLMs. It relaxes this assumption by explicitly
modeling the non-independent error structure with one or more estimated
parameters. All parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood.</p>
<p>We will analyze the <code>hawaii</code> dataset, which I’ve
pre-loaded. Specifically, we will model the square-root transformed
abundance of <code>Moorhen.Kauai</code> as a function of
<code>Year</code> and <code>Rainfall</code> (no interaction).
<code>sqrt(Moorhen.Kauai) ~ Year</code> assesses whether abundance
changes linearly through time, while
<code>sqrt(Moorhen.Kauai) ~ Rainfall</code> assesses whether abundance
changes as a linear function of rainfall. Feel free to plot the data
(e.g., as time series, scatter plots) to see what it looks like.</p>
<p>We will compare the results using <code>lm()</code>
vs. <code>gls()</code>. So go ahead and fit a multiple regression using
<code>lm()</code>. Then do the same using <code>gls()</code>. This
function requires two additional arguments:
<code>correlation = corAR1(form = ~Year)</code> and
<code>na.action = na.omit</code>. The first argument tells R to model
the autocorrelated errors using an AR1 structure
(<code>form = ~Year</code> tells R that <code>Year</code> is a time IV;
otherwise, time would correspond to the order of observations). That is,
<code>gls()</code> will estimate a parameter, <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which is the correlation between
errors one time step apart. <span class="math inline">\(\rho ^
2\)</span> is the correlation between errors two time steps apart, <span
class="math inline">\(\rho ^ 3\)</span> is the correlation between
errors three time steps apart, etc. The second argument in
<code>gls()</code> tells R to delete <code>NA</code>, something
<code>lm()</code> does automatically.</p>

<p>First note the high value for estimated <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, illustrating that there’s strong
autocorrelation in the errors (<code>Phi1</code> is equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>).</p>
<p>Now compare the coefficients and P-values between GLM and GLS. As you
can see, the coefficients are fairly similar, and the significant
P-values in GLM are smaller than their counterparts in GLS. This is to
be expected: the non-independent errors will decrease P-values and
increase Type I error rate in GLM. When the non-independent errors are
accounted for, the P-values will increase to their “proper” values,
though they’re still significant in this case. The takeaway here is that
GLM coefficient estimates are unbiased, even in the face of
autocorrelated errors. So if you care only about coefficient estimates
and not P-values, just go ahead and use <code>lm()</code>!</p>
<p>Now plot the ACFs of the residuals from both models. For the
<code>gls()</code> results, you have to extract residuals using
<code>resid()</code> with argument <code>type = "normalized"</code>.
Otherwise, the residuals will not be corrected using the estimated <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> parameter.</p>
<p>As you can see, the GLM residuals still show (significant) positive
autocorrelation at lag = 1. This autocorrelation disappears in GLS, as
to be expected (since the autocorrelation is modeled and removed).</p>
<p>For spatial data, errors are modeled using five models:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Exponential (<code>corExp</code>)</li>
<li>Gaussian (<code>corGaus</code>)</li>
<li>Linear (<code>corLin</code>)</li>
<li>Rational quadratic (<code>corRatio</code>)</li>
<li>Spherical (<code>corSpher</code>)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Accounting for autocorrelated errors using an IV</h2>
<p>Autocorrelated errors can be accounted for by including an IV that
has the same autocorrelation structure. In other words, the
autocorrelation in the errors can be modeled by the IV, thereby removing
autocorrelation from the residuals. For example, an herbivore species’
abundance is autocorrelated because it follows plant distribution, which
itself is autocorrelated; if one models herbivore abundance as a
function of plant distribution, then the autocorrelation in herbivore is
explained by plant, thus producing independent errors. If model errors
are independent, then this GLM assumption is satisfied, and P-values
will be “normal” (no need for any correction!).</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of this, using the example I used in lecture.
Below are spatial correlograms for an index of wetness and number of
boreal tree species. As you can see, the autocorrelation structures are
very similar, implying that spatial distribution of wetness affects
distribution of boreal species (or both are affected by some third
variable).</p>
<p><img src="Week11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="" width="624" /><img src="Week11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>Now create a linear model, using <code>lm()</code>, where
<code>boreal ~ Wet</code> (the data frame is called
<code>Boreality</code>). Then create a spatial correlogram of the
residuals, using
<code>correlogram(surf.ls(0, Boreality$x, Boreality$y, lm.res$residuals), nint = 300)</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="bor" data-completion="1"

data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Click &quot;Solution&quot; button if stuck</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>

correlogram(surf.ls(0, Boreality$x, Boreality$y, lm.res$residuals), nint = 300)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, there is still some leftover positive autocorrelation
in the residuals, but the distance at which autocorrelation persists has
drastically decreased. Moreover, the new correlogram appears flatter and
“hugs” zero more, indicating less autocorrelation at all lags. Thus, the
autocorrelation in <code>boreal</code> has been mostly accounted for by
the similar autocorrelation structure in <code>Wet</code>, leaving less
autocorrelation in the <code>lm()</code> residuals.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For this question, we will work with the <code>co2</code> time
series (see the help file for more details). First plot the time series
with <code>plot(co2)</code>. Then detrend the data by fitting a linear
model and then taking residuals (because the time series has equally
spaced data points, you can transform this into a <code>numeric</code>
class first and then model it as a function of
<code>c(1:length(co2))</code>). Lastly, create an autocorrelation
function plot of the detrended time series.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we will work with two time series: <code>mdeaths</code> and
<code>fdeaths</code> (see their help file for more info about the data).
First plot each time series. Then create a cross-correlation function
plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s analyze the <code>hawaii</code> dataset again and see if
another bird species shows a more noticeable relationship with
<code>rainfall</code>. Fit a generalized least squares model with
<code>sqrt(sqrt(Stilt.Maui))</code> (i.e., a double square-root
transformation) as a function of <code>Year</code> and
<code>Rainfall</code> (no interaction). Make sure to specify that the
autocorrelation structure is <code>corAR1()</code> as a function of
<code>Year</code>. Then create a ACF plot of the residuals, making sure
to use the residuals that have been GLS-corrected for
autocorrelation.</p></li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We took a leap into some fairly complicated concepts and methods this
week, so if you understood at least 50% of the lecture and tutorial
material, you should feel very proud!</p>
<p>Linear mixed models are becoming more common in (biological)
anthropology, though there’s a good chance they’re misused and
misunderstood. Here, we covered the fundamentals of LMMs and learned
what random factors are and when to use them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>if we’re interested in estimating the SD of intercepts and/or slopes
across levels</li>
<li>if our sample size is too small relative to the number of estimated
coefficients needed if using fixed factors</li>
<li>if we want to use shrinkage/regularization to shrink estimates
towards the population mean</li>
<li>if we want to account for non-independence using blocking</li>
<li>if we want to partition variance among the random factors.</li>
</ol>
<p>We then learned about non-independence (i.e., autocorrelation) in a
more nuanced way. Autocorrelation is often thought of as a nuisance that
needs to be corrected for in statistics. I, however, prefer to think of
autocorrelation as interesting structure in the data that can tell us
something about the processes that generated the observed patterns. We
can measure and quantify autocorrelation using correlograms (for
temporal, spatial, and even phylogenetic data). We then learned how to
quantify the association between two variables in time and space using
cross-correlograms (cf. correlation) and generalized least squares
(cf. linear models). It is important to keep in mind that autocorrelated
model errors can be eliminated by including the proper IV. And even if
errors are autocorrelated, coefficient estimates are unbiased and only
P-values are affected (they’re biased downward).</p>
<p>Hopefully, this week’s lecture and tutorial have given you enough
fundamentals, so you can begin to explore LMMs and autocorrelation in
your own research. We have only scratched the surface, so there’s much
more to learn on your own!
