<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week, we learned all about <strong>multiple linear
regression</strong>. Multiple linear regression (hereafter, “multiple
regression”) is a straightforward extension of simple linear regression,
where the former has two or more independent variables, while the latter
has only one. Therefore, virtually everything you learned for simple
linear regression applies here. In fact, I don’t even make a distinction
between the two in my head: they’re the same model and all that differs
is the number of independent variables.</p>
<p><img

style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>The dependent variable in multiple regression is typically
continuous, whereas the independent variables can be continuous or
categorical. For this week, however, we will go over continuous
independent variables only (categorical independent variables are the
topic of next week’s lecture).</p>
<p>This tutorial will cover many of the neat things we can do with
multiple regression, and why it is many times better to compare the
slopes (i.e., coefficients) of independent variables within the same
multiple regression model, as opposed to multiple simple linear models
(provided that the multiple regression model assumptions are not grossly
violated).</p>

<h2>Multiple regression coefficients</h2>
<p>As I taught in lecture, multiple regression coefficients are
estimated in the same exact way as in simple linear regression: ordinary
least squares, where residuals are minimized. The fitted plane must pass
through the mean of the DV and all IVs. Thus, one can think of fitting
the plane to data by rotating the plane around a fixed swivel point
(i.e., the mean of DV and IVs), until the residuals are minimized. For a
multiple regression model with two IVs, this can be visualized in three
dimensions, where the two IVs and DV are plotted on a scatter plot with
three axes, and the plane is a two-dimensional surface.</p>
<p><img
src="http://www.rnfc.org/courses/isl/Lesson%203/Summary/Figures/Figure3-4.png"
style="width:60.0%" /></p>
<p>With more than two IVs, we would need more than three dimensions,
which humans cannot visualize, so just think of the same process
happening in some abstract higher-dimensional space.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interpreting-coefficients" class="section level2">
<h2>Interpreting coefficients</h2>
<p>This is the formula for a multiple regression model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \ldots +
\beta_n X_n + \epsilon,
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the DV, <span
class="math inline">\(X_{1..n}\)</span> are the different IVs, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the intercept, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_{1...n}\)</span> are the slope estimates
(i.e., coefficients) for each IV, and <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the error term or
residual.</p>
<p>The intercept is interpreted in the same exact way as in simple
linear regression: the DV value when all IVs are set to zero. Each
estimated slope is interpreted as the change in DV when the IV in
question increases by one, <em>when all other IVs are held
constant.</em> One can see why this would be of interest: we often want
to isolate and understand the effect of a single IV on the DV. In fact,
researchers will often include an IV that they’re not interested in just
so they can remove its effect when interpreting other multiple
regression coefficients (these “uninteresting” IVs are called
<strong>covariates</strong>).</p>
<p>Let’s fit a multiple regression to some data from <code>mtcars</code>
and understand how the coefficients are interpreted.</p>
<p>We will start with two IVs only, but everything you will learn can
easily be extended to more. In R, the IVs within a multiple regression
model are to the right of <code>~</code> and are separated by
<code>+</code>. Fit the model
<code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat, data = mtcars)</code> below, and save it to
an object.</p>

predict(lm.res, data.frame(hp = 0, drat = 0))
diff(predict(lm.res, data.frame(hp = c(10, 10), drat = 1:2)))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Let’s first use the <code>predict()</code> function to get the
expected DV when <code>hp</code> and <code>drat</code> are set to zero
(click the “Solution” button if you don’t remember how to do this). As
you’ll see, the predicted DV value is the estimated intercept.</p>
<p>Now let’s sharpen our intuition about interpreting multiple
regression coefficients by increasing <code>drat</code> from 1 to 2,
while fixing <code>hp</code> at some value (pick whichever value you’d
like!). Use the <code>predict()</code> function again and see if the
change in DV is exactly the coefficient estimate for <code>drat</code>
(you can wrap <code>diff()</code> around your code to get the difference
in values). Try other values for <code>hp</code> and see if you get the
same answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interpreting-coefficients-as-partialing-out-other-ivs"
class="section level2">
<h2>Interpreting coefficients as partialing out other IVs</h2>
<p>Another very similar way to think about, for example, the
<code>drat</code> coefficient is by removing or
<strong>partialing</strong> out the effect of <code>hp</code> (this is
why multiple regression coefficients are often called <strong>partial
regression coefficients</strong>). Recall that the residuals from
<code>lm(y ~ x)</code> are interpreted as the signal in <code>y</code>
after the effect of <code>x</code> has been removed. Thus, to partial
out the effect of <code>hp</code> from both <code>qsec</code> and
<code>drat</code>, we fit linear models of each as a function of
<code>hp</code> and then take the residuals. Do this below, and then
regress the residuals from <code>qsec ~ hp</code> as a function of the
residuals from <code>drat ~ hp</code>. The resulting slope should be
exactly the coefficient for <code>drat</code> in the multiple regression
model (i.e., <code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat, data = mtcars)</code>).</p>

<div id="section-adding-more-ivs-to-your-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Adding more IVs to your model</h2>
<p>One might think that adding more IVs to your multiple regression
model is a good thing, since you can account for more IVs when studying
your IV(s) of interest, and the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>
also increases. However, there is no “free lunch” in statistics and
benefits are usually accrued at a cost elsewhere. Here, we will see how
this happens in action.</p>
<div id="section-increasing-r2" class="section level3">
<h3>Increasing <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></h3>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> can only increase or stay
the same as you add more IVs to your model. This is because another IV
can only explain more of the residual variation (<span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> increases) or it does not help at all
(<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> stays the same). <em><span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> will never decrease if you add more
IVs.</em></p>
<p>Let’s see how this works by comparing the <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of <code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat)</code>
to that of <code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat + wt)</code>.</p>

summary(lm(qsec ~ hp + drat + wt, data = mtcars))$r.squared
summary(lm(qsec ~ hp + drat + wt + mpg, data = mtcars))$r.squared

</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> increased by about ~0.1.
It’ll increase again if you add <code>mpg</code> (try this out
above).</p>
<p>At some point, however, your model will overfit the data. That is,
it’ll start fitting the noise in your dataset (bad), as opposed to the
signal (good).</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1848/1*_7OPgojau8hkiPUiHoGK_w.png"
style="width:90.0%" /></p>
<p>This is especially true as your ratio of data points to parameters
decreases (general rule is that you should have at least 20 data points
per parameter). Overfitting is bad since you’re not focusing on the
signal and pattern of interest anymore (i.e., how your DV changes with
some IV) and instead you’re starting to fit the noise structure (i.e.,
factors aside from the IVs that influence the DV). Overfitting is
extremely bad when you want to predict DVs for a new dataset, since the
noise structure in the new dataset will not match what is in your
original data.</p>
<p>Overfitting aside, the more IVs in one’s model, the higher the <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, all else being equal. Thus,
comparing <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> between models with
different numbers of IVs is an apples-to-oranges comparison (assuming
both models have the same number of data points). The <strong>adjusted
<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></strong> corrects the <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> to account for additional parameters.
Its formula is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  R_a^2 = 1 - \frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1}(1 - R^2),
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of data
points, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the number of
independent variables, and <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is
the original coefficient of determination. As you can see from the
formula, as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> goes up, <span
class="math inline">\(R_a^2\)</span> goes down.</p>
<p>Compare the adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> between
<code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat)</code> and
<code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat + mpg)</code> (the adjusted <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> can be called with
<code>summary(lm())$adj.r.squared</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-increasing-standard-error" class="section level3">
<h3>Increasing standard error</h3>
<p>Increasing your number of IVs will also increase the standard error
of your coefficient estimates. I like to think of it as if you increase
the number of IVs, keeping the number of data points the same, you have
less information and statistical power to devote to each coefficient
(recall from an earlier lecture that larger sample sizes decrease
standard errors). Larger standard errors mean larger P-values and less
precise predicted DVs.</p>
<p>Compare the standard errors for <code>hp</code> and <code>drat</code>
in <code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat)</code>
vs. <code>lm(qsec ~ hp + drat + wt + mpg)</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>The somewhat paradoxical result is that a more precise prediction
might result if you <em>don’t</em> include all IVs that actually affect
the DV in reality. This trade-off is known as the bias-variance
trade-off: with more IVs, your prediction will become less biased (they
will be closer to the true value on average), but they will become less
precise. The goal is to find the “Goldilocks” middle-ground, where you
have some bias and imprecision but both are minimized together. This is
a big issue in machine learning.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-interaction-terms" class="section level2">
<h2>Interaction terms</h2>
<p>Interaction terms are needed when the slope of a DV against an IV
changes as a function of another IV. The example I used in class is that
of a marathon runner whose time decreases as they train more. This
relationship is most likely affected by the quality of equipment they
use: with better equipment, one might expect the slope to decrease, such
that marathon time decreases even more with training time.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/andrewdu1/ANTH674/blob/master/Datasets/Interaction%20marathon.jpg?raw=true"
style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>In this example, an interaction is needed between training time and
equipment quality.</p>
<p>So in brief, an interaction term indicates that the slope between
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, for example, changes as a function
of <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>. And because interaction
terms are symmetrical, this also implies that the slope between <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> changes as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>. The multiple regression formula,
including an interaction term, is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 (X_1 \times X_2) +
\epsilon.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>In R, one fits an interaction model with
<code>lm(y ~ x1 * x2)</code>; the <code>*</code> implies <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> (from the formula) are estimated
too. If you just want to fit the interaction term and estimate <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span> only, you use <code>:</code>
instead of <code>*</code>, though this is rarely done.</p>
<p>A positive interaction term means that the slope of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> <em>increases</em> as <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> increases (and the slope of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> increases with <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>). A negative interaction term means
that the slope of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function
of <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> <em>decreases</em> as <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> increases (and the slope of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> decreases with <span
class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>).</p>
<p>We can see how this works, using the multiple regression formula
itself. I have simulated a DV (<code>y</code>) and two IVs that interact
(<code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>); all variables are found in the
dataframe, <code>DF</code>, which is preloaded into your console. Fit a
multiple regression model with an interaction term between
<code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>, and save the results to an object.
I have also created a function for you in the console
(<code>slope_x1()</code>) to get out the slope of <code>y ~ x1</code>
for a given value of <code>x2</code>; the two arguments are the fitted
interaction model and a vector of values for <code>x2</code>. So, use
<code>slope_x1()</code> to get a vector of expected <code>y ~ x1</code>
slopes for the interaction model and a vector of <code>x2</code> values.
Plot the slopes against <code>x2</code>, and fit a linear model to get
the slope of this relationship.</p>

<p>As you can see, the estimated slope (<code>slopes ~ x2</code>) is the
interaction term itself! So you can now interpret an interaction term,
which is the exact amount the slope of <code>y ~ x1</code> changes as
<code>x2</code> increases by one. Interactions are symmetrical, so the
interaction term is also the amount the slope of <code>y ~ x2</code>
changes as <code>x1</code> increases by one.</p>
<div id="section-quadratic-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Quadratic regression</h3>
<p>An IV can interact with itself, and this is known as a quadratic
function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}

<p>To fit a quadratic linear model, you need one extra function within
<code>lm()</code>: <code>I()</code>. For example, to fit a quadratic
model to <code>y</code> and <code>x</code>, you need to enter
<code>lm(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2))</code>. The <code>I()</code> tells R that
<code>^</code> should be treated “as is”, i.e., a raised-to-the-power
operator in the formula. See what happens when you fit a linear model
without <code>I()</code> (compare it to <code>lm(y ~ x)</code>).</p>
<p>Go ahead and fit the quadratic model. To add the regression line to
the scatter plot, we cannot use <code>abline()</code> anymore, which
only works for models with straight lines (i.e., simple linear
regression). We now have to use the <code>curve()</code> and
<code>predict()</code> functions, so calling the fitted quadratic model
<code>lm.quad</code>, the proper code is
<code>curve(predict(lm.quad, data.frame(x = x)), add = TRUE)</code>. Use
this code to add the fitted quadratic model to the scatter plot.</p>

<h2>Collinearity</h2>
<p><strong>Collinearity</strong>, also known as
<strong>multicollinearity</strong>, occurs when two or more IVs are
strongly correlated in a multiple regression model. This is a violation
of one of the assumptions of multiple regression, and it results in
coefficient estimates that are unstable (the “bouncing betas” problem;
coefficients are informally called “betas”). What do I mean by
“unstable”? This is best illustrated through example.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the multiple regression model,
<code>lm(qsec ~ hp + wt, data = mtcars)</code>. To see how these
variables are related to each other, create a scatter plot matrix (it
might help to first subset out these three variables from the
<code>mtcars</code> dataframe). Feel free to add lowess curves,
correlation coefficients, or any other scatter plot matrix modification
you learned in last week’s tutorial.</p>

</div>
<p>You can see that <code>qsec</code> is strongly correlated with
<code>hp</code>, but not so much with <code>wt</code>, and
<code>hp</code> and <code>wt</code> are strongly correlated.</p>
<p>Estimate the coefficients for the multiple linear regression model,
and look at the P-values as well.</p>
<p>Now estimate the coefficients for <code>hp</code> and <code>wt</code>
separately in two simple linear regression models (i.e.,
<code>lm(qsec ~ hp)</code> and <code>lm(qsec ~ wt)</code>). Compare the
coefficients and P-values for each IV between the multiple regression
and simple regression models.</p>
<p>You can see that the <code>hp</code> coefficient did not change too
much between the models, but the P-value changed by two orders of
magnitude. More striking is that the <code>wt</code> coefficient changed
from positive to negative and significant to not significant when going
from multiple to simple regression. Such a drastic change in coefficient
values and significance is prime evidence for collinearity, i.e.,
coefficients will change quite a bit when a collinear IV is added to or
dropped from the model. We know based on intuition that a larger
<code>wt</code> should result in a slower car (<code>qsec</code>) on
average, so the positive coefficient in the multiple regression is
suspect and indicates collinearity. This is borne out by the high
correlation coefficient between <code>hp</code> and <code>wt</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, the <code>wt</code> coefficient in the multiple regression
model is unreliable. Recall that a coefficient in multiple regression is
defined as the change in DV as IV increases by one, holding all other
IVs constant. If the target IV is strongly correlated with another IV,
then it is not possible to look at how the DV changes as a function of
the target IV while holding the other IV constant. The more collinear
your IVs are, the more your coefficients and P-values will change if a
collinear IV is added or dropped. If your IVs are 100% uncorrelated,
then the multiple regression coefficients will be identical to their
counterparts in simple linear regression.</p>
<p>Solutions to collinearity include dropping one of the collinear IVs,
since they offer redundant information anyway. The variables could also
be combined using principal components analysis (which you’ll learn
about in a future lecture). Or nothing can be done, since collinearity
does not affect predictions nor <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>
values. So, how to address collinearity depends on your research
question!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-detecting-collinearity" class="section level2">
<h2>Detecting collinearity</h2>
<p>This can be done using correlation coefficients and scatter plot
matrices (as in the previous topic). Another useful metric is the
<strong>variance inflation factor</strong>, which is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  VIF_j = \frac{1}{1 - R_j^2},
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_j^2\)</span> is the <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> calculated from a regression model
regressing <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> on all other IVs.
While correlation coefficients only tell us about collinearity when
comparing two IVs at a time, VIFs can tell us if collinearity exists
among three or more IVs.</p>
<p>Calculate the VIF for <code>wt</code> in the
<code>lm(qsec ~ hp + wt)</code> model (you can use the equation or the
<code>vif()</code> function in the <code>car</code> package). A general
rule is that a VIF &gt; 10 indicates that your IV is strongly collinear
with others.</p>

<p>You can see that the VIF here is actually quite low (1.77)! This is
an example where statistical nuance trumps general rules. The

significant to not significant is clearly worrisome, so collinearity is
definitely a problem here.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-variance-partitioning" class="section level2">
<h2>Variance partitioning</h2>
<p>A really useful and informative statistical tool is <strong>variance
partitioning</strong>, where the variation in the DV is partitioned into
components explained by each IV uniquely and jointly across multiple
IVs. This is clearly of interest for most, if not all, research
questions, but it remains unused in anthropology (definitely in
paleoanthropology). Moreover, the results are unaffected by
collinearity, and in fact, they can tell us how collinear IVs are.</p>
<p>We will learn how to do variance partitioning using the
<code>mpg</code> (DV), <code>hp</code>, and <code>wt</code> variables
from <code>mtcars</code>. Below is the Venn Diagram from my lecture,
showing how we should think about how DV variation is attributed to each
of the three parts of the Venn Diagram.</p>
<p><img
src="https://github.com/andrewdu1/ANTH674/blob/master/Datasets/varpart.jpg?raw=true"
style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>First, we need to get the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>
from the full model: <code>lm(mpg ~ hp + wt)</code>. Then, we need to
get the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> from the simple
regression for each IV. See if you can then reason through how to get
each of the three components: DV variation explained (1) uniquely by
<code>hp</code>, (2) uniquely by <code>wt</code>, and (3) jointly by
<code>hp</code> and <code>wt</code>. A nice way of checking your
calculations is by summing the three components to see if they match the
<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of the full model. You can
click the “Solution” button if stuck.</p>

know how much DV variation is attributed to each IV separately, and how
much cannot be disentangled between the two IVs.</p>
<p>Variance partitioning can be done on more than two IVs. It helps to
have a Venn Diagram drawn out, so you can reason out how to calculate

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have covered all the fundamentals necessary for you to use
multiple regression in your own research. Multiple regression is a
powerful way to compare the effects of each IV on the DV, while holding
the other IVs constant. Transformations might be needed to aid
interpretation of the coefficients: centering and scaling if IVs are in
different units or differ by multiple orders of magnitude, or
log-transformations if variables increase multiplicatively (also gets
rid of the problem of different units).</p>
<p>However, as models become more complicated, there are more
assumptions involved and more pitfalls you have to watch out for (always
check your diagnostic plots!). For multiple regression, these include
being aware of the “penalty” incurred for including extra IVs and
collinearity. Collinearity is problematic when you’re interested in
making inferences about the coefficients themselves (i.e., what their
estimates are, whether they’re significant), but it’s not a problem if
you’re interested in prediction or goodness of fit. In other words,
whether collinearity matters depends on your research question (this is
true of virtually all model assumption violations)!</p>
<p>Interactions are a powerful way to interpret your data in a more
nuanced fashion. They may also be necessary if the model without
interactions terms is misspecified (i.e., assumptions are violated).
However, try not to add interactions haphazardly; it is instead better
to incorporate them if theory or intuition dictates it. If the goal of
your research question requires an assumption to not be violated and
this can only happen with an interaction term, then you can go ahead and
add it.</p>
<p>Lastly, variance partitioning is a great tool for scientific
inference! I strongly encourage you to use it if you’ll use multiple
regression in your research.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand everything we covered in lecture and this
tutorial. All of this material will served as the foundation for next
week’s lecture, where we will learn about general linear models with
non-continuous IVs and DVs (e.g., ANOVA, logistic regression). Thus,
everything you learned here applies there as well!
