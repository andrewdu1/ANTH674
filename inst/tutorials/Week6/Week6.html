<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week’s lecture covered mostly theoretical and conceptual topics, so there aren’t many new methods and functions to learn. But, we can use R to illustrate how these concepts work in a concrete way using simulations.</p>
<p>To review, there are three main modes of statistical inference:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
<li>Confirmatory data analysis or hypothesis testing</li>
<li>Prediction</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0-d8jb2KRK0/WlwCJk3xptI/AAAAAAAAAzA/NaHF_58FseUQIjeCFBL3tZ_-ADA4EM3yACLcBGAs/s1600/Difference%2BBetween%2BConfirmatory%2Band%2BExploratory%2BResearch.JPG" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>These three modes have mutually exclusive goals, and you should <em>never</em> do more than one on the same set of data. Knowing which mode is the right one for your research question creates a clear path for you, regarding which analyses you should do and how you should do them. This knowledge also ensures that you will not abuse statistics and find an effect where one doesn’t exist in reality. All this is part of learning how to translate your research question into a statistical one, often the most difficult part of a research project!</p>
<p>After learning about these topics in lecture, this tutorial, and the HW, you should have a clearer understanding of the different modes of statistical inference and how to operationalize them in your own research.</p>
<p>I also realized that I never taught you how to save a plot as a PDF, so I will teach you how to do so in this tutorial. You will also learn how to write your own function, which comes in handy when you have to do the same thing over and over to different objects.</p>

<div id="section-exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory data analysis</h2>
<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is done when one has very little idea about the patterns and relationships in the variables of interest. As a result, there is no <em>a priori</em> hypothesis that can be tested because we have no idea what the hypothesis should be!</p>
<p>EDA can be used to find relationships that serve as fodder for future hypotheses to be tested after the fact (i.e., <em>a posteriori</em>). The <em>a posteriori</em> nature of these relationships need to be emphasized because one can find a relationship just by chance, even though there is none in reality (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). Therefore, such relationships should not be presented as real and instead should be presented as preliminary hypotheses that need to be confirmed with independent datasets.</p>
<p>EDA is commonly accomplished by plotting variables (e.g., histograms and scatter plots for continuous data) and calculating simple descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, correlation coefficients). And as emphasized in lecture, <em>never</em> calculate P-values in EDA, as these can be significant by chance, especially if one is looking at many relationships. Not to mention, a P-value is an explicit statement about the data, assuming some hypothesis is true, so P-values don’t make much sense in EDA, as there are no hypotheses to be tested.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-scatter-plot-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>Scatter plot matrix</h2>
<p>A scatter plot matrix is an excellent tool for EDA. To create a scatter plot matrix, we are going to first simulate 6 independent, unrelated variables, each of which has 20 data points. We can do this by simulating 120 normal random variables (just use the default <code>mean</code> and <code>sd</code> arguments) and placing them into a matrix with 6 columns. Use <code>set.seed(100)</code>, so your results match mine. Can you figure out the code for all this (click the “Solution” button if stuck)?</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="var10" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># click the &quot;Solution&quot; button if stuck</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="var10-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>n_var &lt;- 6
n &lt;- 20

set.seed(100)
x &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n_var * n), ncol = n_var)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To create a scatter plot matrix, we use the <code>pairs()</code> function. Go ahead and use the function on your matrix, and see what you get.</p>
<p>The resulting plot shows a scatter plot between each pairwise combination of variables. For example, to see the scatter plot between var 1 and var 3, we find the plot that intersects the var 1 column and the var 3 row (third row, first column). This is a scatter plot with var 1 on the x-axis and var 3 on the y-axis. The other var 1 &amp; var 3 scatter plot in the upper triangle (row 1, column 3) shows the same, but the axes are now swapped.</p>
<p>Because the upper triangle shows redundant information, we can replace it with something more informative. In the <code>pairs()</code> help file in the <em>Examples</em> section, there are additional functions that can be used in scatter plot matrices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>panel.cor()</code>: gives Pearson correlation coefficients</li>
<li><code>panel.hist()</code>: plots histograms</li>
<li><code>panel.smooth()</code>: creates scatter plots with a lowess smoother, which fits a flexible curve to your data</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> you can add a lowess line to any scatter plot with <code>lines(lowess(x, y))</code>.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the <code>panel.cor()</code> and <code>panel.hist()</code> functions into your console (<code>panel.smooth()</code> seems to be built in). Now we can change the upper triangle to be correlation coefficients using the <code>pairs()</code> argument <code>upper.panel = panel.cor</code>, and we can make the diagonals histograms instead of variable names with the argument <code>diag.panel = panel.hist</code>. Give this a try above.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-correlation-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>Correlation matrix</h2>
<p>We can also quickly calculate a correlation matrix for our variables using the <code>cor()</code> function.</p>
<p>I have written the code from before into the console below. Try out <code>cor(x)</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="cor_mat" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>n_var &lt;- 6
n &lt;- 20

set.seed(100)
x &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n_var * n), ncol = n_var)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>The correlation matrix is interpreted in exactly the same way as the scatter plot matrix, in terms of finding the correlation coefficient corresponding to two variables of interest (can you figure out what the diagonals are all ones?). These are Pearson correlation coefficients by default; if you want rank correlation coefficients, use the argument <code>method =</code>.</p>
<p>We can see that the Pearson coefficient for var 3 and var 4 is fairly high (0.56). To get the corresponding P-values for the correlation matrix, we are going to use the <code>rcorr()</code> function in the <code>Hmisc</code> package, so you need to install this package if you don’t have it already (<code>install.packages("Hmisc", dep = TRUE)</code>).</p>
<p>Load the package using <code>library(Hmisc)</code>, and then use the <code>rcorr()</code> function on the <code>x</code> matrix; save the results to object <code>cor.res</code>.</p>
<p><code>cor.res$r</code> brings up the correlation matrix, which you already calculated above. <code>cor.res$P</code> brings up the corresponding P-values. As you can see, there is only one significant P-value: that comparing var 3 and var 4 (P = 0.01). But, we know that this is a false positive, given that we simulated all these variables to be unrelated, random normal variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-eda-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>EDA summary</h2>
<p>You can find a significant, large correlation coefficient just by chance during EDA, even if the null hypothesis is true. This is especially likely if you conduct many tests. Thus, you should always be skeptical of high correlation coefficients during EDA and only present them as intriguing hypotheses that need to be tested with independent datasets.</p>
<p>That said, the probability of getting a large, significant correlation coefficient (or some other test statistic) is 5% if the null hypothesis is true. So if you calculate 20 correlation coefficients and find 15 are very large, you’re likely onto something real, as getting 20 large coefficients by chance is miniscule (assuming all null hypotheses are true).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-saving-a-plot-as-a-pdf" class="section level2">
<h2>Saving a plot as a PDF</h2>
<p>It’s nice to see plots in RStudio while you’re playing around with data, but you need to learn how to save them as PDFs if you want to finalize plots for presentations, publications, etc. Plots within R look somewhat pixelated, but that gets smoothed out when they’re saved as a PDF.</p>
<p>Saving a plot as a PDF is easy in R. Here are the steps involved:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Use the <code>pdf()</code> function to begin the saving process. The only arguments I consistently use are <code>file =</code>, <code>width =</code>, and <code>height =</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>file =</code> specifies the directory path for where you want to save the file to (make sure you end with the PDF file name and <code>.pdf</code>!). For example, <code>pdf("C:/Users/adu/Desktop/Test plots.pdf")</code>.</li>
<li><code>width =</code> controls the width of the plot (default is <code>7</code> for seven inches)</li>
<li><code>height =</code> controls the height of the plot (default is <code>7</code> for seven inches)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create one or more plots. If you create multiple plots, each one will be saved on a different page within your PDF file.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell R you’re done saving to the PDF with <code>dev.off()</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By using <code>pdf()</code> and writing down the file directory path and file name, you’re also creating a written record of what plots you’re creating, where you’re saving them to, and what the file name(s) is.</p>
<p>The default PDF plot dimension is a 7in x 7in square. To preview what your plot looks like in this dimension, you can enter <code>windows()</code> (for PC) or <code>quartz()</code> (for Mac) to create a blank, square plotting screen. Then, you can create your plot and see what it looks like! You can create as many plotting windows as you’d like, which is great for comparing plots.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> These functions are kind of wonky in the tutorial (though give it a shot) and <em>definitely</em> wonky in RMarkdown. Use them primarily in R scripts or when working in your R console.</p>
<p>Try saving two plots as a PDF below. That is, create two plots (whatever you’d like) as two separate pages in a saved PDF file.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pdf" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-confirmatory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Confirmatory data analysis</h2>
<p>The second statistical inferential mode we covered is confirmatory data analysis (CDA) or hypothesis testing. This mode is used when you want to test an <em>a priori</em> hypothesis with confidence intervals or P-values (in fact, CDA is the only time you should <em>ever</em> calculate a P-value!). <em>A priori</em> means you specified the hypothesis <em>before</em> you saw the data.</p>
<p><em>A priori</em> hypotheses can come from intuition, theory, or previous exploratory analyses. For the latter, you need to test the hypothesis with a dataset that is independent from the one used to discover the hypothesis (accomplished via EDA).</p>
<p>We have previously covered how to calculate P-values and confidence intervals, so the following topic will cover how we deal with multiple comparisons (i.e., when many tests are conducted).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4IPBNE3e20E/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:40.0%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-multiple-comparisons" class="section level2">
<h2>Multiple comparisons</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, the more tests you run, the more likely you’ll find a large, significant statistic just by chance (assuming the null hypothesis is true). More precisely, on average 5% of your tests will be significant, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, it is common practice to correct your significance level or P-values if you conduct many tests.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-bonferroni-correction" class="section level2">
<h2>Bonferroni correction</h2>
<p>This is the most common method, but it is also problematic for a number of reasons, which I’ll discuss in the next section.</p>
<p>As I covered in lecture, Bonferroni corrections adjust the <strong>family-wise error rate</strong> (FWER), which is the probability of committing at least one Type I error within a set of tests. Specifically, Bonferroni corrects FWER to be 0.05, <em>assuming all null hypotheses are true</em>. It creates a new significance level (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{BC}\)</span>), defined as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{BC} = \alpha / k\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the traditional 0.05 significance level, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of tests conducted.</p>
<p><img src="http://alterealitygam.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Type_I_and_Type_II_Error_Table.jpg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>In R, we can use the <code>p.adjust()</code> function with argument <code>method = "bonferroni</code> to automatically calculate Bonferroni-corrected P-values. Let’s do so using our six variables from before. I have written the code for you, and the P-values are saved as object <code>p.vals</code>. Use <code>p.adjust()</code> on <code>p.vals</code> below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="bonferroni" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>n_var &lt;- 6

x &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n_var * n), ncol = n_var)

cor.res &lt;- rcorr(x)
p.vals &lt;- cor.res$P[lower.tri(cor.res$P)] # lower.tri() is a function to get the lower triangle from a matrix. upper.tri() gets the upper triangle</code></pre>

</div>
<p>You can see that none of the P-values are now significant, which is the correct result, given that these variables are simulated to be unrelated to each other.</p>
<div id="section-issues-with-bonferroni" class="section level3">
<h3>Issues with Bonferroni</h3>
<p>As taught in lecture, Bonferroni is overly conservative because it assumes the null hypothesis is true for <em>ALL</em> of your tests, which is likely to be false. This means all tests are considered to contribute to the FWER, and all need to be corrected (even if the null hypothesis is false in reality for some tests). As a result, the probability of committing a Type I error has certainly decreased, but the probability of committing a Type II error (failing to reject the null if it’s false) has increased. This is okay if your research question dictates that you should be very conservative about making statements about statistical significance, but a Type II error is still an error.</p>
<p>Let’s see how Bonferroni plays out when some pairwise correlations between variables are <em>NOT</em> zero.</p>
<p>We are going to simulate a large dataset with 100 variables, each of which has 20 data points. 50 variables are going to be random, uncorrelated normal variables, and the other 50 are going to be correlated with each other. Therefore, we <em>know</em> that the null hypothesis is actually false for 1225 tests. (To calculate the number of pairwise combinations possible from 50 variables, we use the binomial coefficient; the R code is <code>choose(50, 2)</code>). I have provided the code for this below.</p>
<p><code>x</code> is the object with all the variables and data points. Use <code>rcorr()</code> to get the P-values from the correlation matrix (refer to the code above; you can click the “Solution” button if you get stuck).</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="bc" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

<p>How many P-values are significant? Is this too high? Now apply the Bonferroni correction to the P-values and count the number of P-values that are less than 0.05.</p>
<p>There are now 94 significant P-values, but we know that there should be 1225 because we simulated our data that way. This shows that only 8% of tests are correctly identified as significant, which is very low (lots of Type II error)! This illustrates the overly conservative nature of the Bonferroni correction. A less conservation correction is the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which is covered next.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-benjamini-hochberg-correction" class="section level2">
<h2>Benjamini-Hochberg correction</h2>
<p>Instead of correcting the FWER, Benjamini-Hochberg corrects the <strong>false discovery rate</strong> (FDR). The FDR is the proportion of false positives in one’s set of significant P-values (i.e., falsified null hypotheses). Therefore, Benjamini-Hochberg is less conservative than Bonferroni because not all tests are penalized and corrected; only those that are significant are considered.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewdu1/ANTH674/master/Datasets/FDR.jpg" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>Refer to the lecture to see how the Benjamini-Hochberg correction is computed. Here, we will only use the <code>p.adjust()</code> function with argument <code>method = "BH"</code>. I have written out the code for our simulated dataset from before. Now apply the Benjamini-Hochberg correction and count how many P-values are significant.</p>

</div>
<p>There are 1165 significant P-values, <em>much</em> closer to the true value of 1225 but still not perfect.</p>
<p>You can see how the Benjamini-Hochberg does a <em>much</em> better job of correcting P-values if the null hypothesis is actually false for some of your tests (which is likely to be the case). Therefore, I recommend using Benjamini-Hochberg over Bonferroni when you need to correct P-values for multiple comparisons. The best solution of all, however, is to not calculate so many P-values in the first place.</p>

<h2>Prediction</h2>
<p>The third and final mode of statistical inference is prediction, which involves fitting a model to data to predict unknown DV, given the known IV in a new dataset. Because the goal of prediction is to predict DV in a <em>new</em> dataset, it is important that we quantify how well our model does on data that wasn’t used to fit the model.</p>
<p>The <strong>training dataset</strong> is the dataset used to fit the model, and the <strong>test dataset</strong> is an independent dataset with known IV and DV, used to assess how well the training model predicts DV in new data. This process is known as <strong>cross-validation</strong>.</p>
<p>You <em>always</em> need to cross-validate when doing prediction. This is because fitting a model to data always involves some noise being fit instead of signal. This is known as <strong>overfitting</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.educative.io/api/edpresso/shot/6668977167138816/image/5033807687188480" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>If the new dataset you want to predict on has a different noise structure than your training dataset (as is likely), then your model will perform poorly. This is why it is so important that your test dataset is as independent from your training dataset as possible; that is, your independent test dataset mimics the new (likely independent) dataset you want to predict on. Thus, a test dataset with known IVs and DVs will give an honest assessment of how well your trained model does on new data, which is the ultimate goal of prediction.</p>

<div id="section-writing-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Writing functions</h2>
<p>Key in assessing how well a model does during prediction are two statistics: <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and root-mean-square error (RMSE). We are going to learn how to write our own functions to calculate these before we use them in cross-validation. But first, let’s illustrate how functions are written with a simple example (you’ll see many parallels with writing a <code>for()</code> loop).</p>
<p>Imagine we wanted a function that multiplies every element within a vector by two. Here are the steps for writing that function (click the “Solution” button if stuck).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Figure out what you want to call your function; this becomes the “object” name (e.g., <code>times2 &lt;-</code>).</li>
<li>Assign to this name a function called <code>function()</code>, whose arguments will become the arguments that go into your function. In this case, we only have one argument: the vector whose elements we multiply by two (e.g., <code>times2 &lt;- function(x)</code>).</li>
<li>Type in an open curly brace (<code>{</code>) right after <code>function()</code>.</li>
<li>On the next line, code what you want done with your arguments (e.g., our vector <code>x</code>). In this case, we want to multiply each element by two (<code>x * 2</code>) and save this to an object.</li>
<li>Now we need to bring our results object out of “function space”; we do so using the <code>return()</code> function, whose argument is the object we want to return.</li>
<li>Enter a closed curly brace on the next line (<code>}</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations, you just wrote your first function! With your coded function in the R system, you can use <code>times2()</code> just as you would with any other function. Try <code>times2(1:10)</code> and see what you get.</p>
<p>Now let’s write our own functions for <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and RMSE.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-writing-functions-r2" class="section level2">
<h2>Writing functions: <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></h2>
<p>You might be thinking why do we need to write our own <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> function when we can easily compute this statistic using R’s built-in functions? R calculates <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> given an inputted IV and DV. For cross-validation, however, we want to calculate <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, given observed DV from the test dataset and predicted DV when the test IV is input into the training model.</p>
<p>The formula for calculating <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align} 
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}},
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(SS_{res}\)</span> is the residual sum of squares (i.e., DV variation unexplained by the model) and <span class="math inline">\(SS_{tot}\)</span> is the total sum of squares (i.e., total variation in the DV). <span class="math inline">\(SS_{res}\)</span> is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    SS_{res} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i}) ^ 2.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>In English, subtract model-predicted DV from observed DV, square the elements, and then sum them all up.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(SS_{tot}\)</span> is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    SS_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \overline{y}) ^ 2.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>In English, subtract mean DV from observed DV, square the elements, and then sum them all up.</p>
<p>Equations are great for coding because each math symbol corresponds to an R function (e.g., sigma translates to <code>sum()</code>).</p>
<p>See if you can code the function for computing <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, given the equations above (click the “Solution” button if stuck). You’ll need two arguments this time: one for observed DV and another for predicted DV.</p>

<p>Simulate two linearly related variables and use your function to calculate <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> (you’ll have to fit a linear model first to get the predicted DV).

</div>
<div id="section-writing-functions-root-mean-square-error" class="section level2">
<h2>Writing functions: root-mean-square error</h2>
<p>Root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a useful statistic for quantifying the deviation between your model predictions and observed DV. The formula is:</p>

    RMSE = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n}}.
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<div id="section-cross-validation" class="section level2">
<h2>Cross-validation</h2>
<p>Two common methods used for cross-validation are the <strong>holdout method</strong> and <strong><em>k</em>-fold</strong> cross-validation. <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation is basically the holdout method repeated <em>k</em> times (i.e., with a <code>for()</code> loop), so we will learn cross-validation using the simpler (but still effective) holdout method.</p>
<p>To learn how to cross-validate, we’re going to practice on the spatially autocorrelated raster I used in lecture. The code for this is below and is adapted <a href="https://gwenantell.com/exploring-spatial-autocorrelation-in-r/">from this site</a> (you will need to install the <code>gstat</code> and <code>sp</code> packages first, using <code>install.packages()</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create empty dataframe for coordinates of 50x50 grid

<p><img src="Week6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The IV and DV are in a dataframe called <code>AC</code>, which also has the x and y coordinates (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, respectively).</p>
<p>Let’s do a 75-25 holdout, where 75% of the dataset is used for training and 25% is used for testing. This is typically done by randomly sampling 75% of the data points from one’s dataset (with the remaining 25% for testing), but we know from lecture that this strategy is fraught when the data are autocorrelated (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.00299.x?casa_token=Vy2V1WNu-vUAAAAA:sdMScTkcVfK_YVSuavhZcHSFl-QfeUCDzw_28rpWiMH31g8oyCAEQoZK3cwG5CfAofqRreDsgDUizkVc">here is a good article illustrating the problem</a>). This is because the underlying autocorrelation structure of the training dataset will be present in the test dataset, thus rendering our model assessment using the test dataset overly optimistic (remember that any new dataset we want to predict on will likely have a different autocorrelation structure). To address this issue with spatial autocorrelation, we want to designate a segregated corner of the map as the test dataset.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let’s use the bottom-right corner of the dataset (i.e., <code>x &gt;= 25</code> and <code>y &lt;= 25</code>). Subset out these data for your test dataset, and the remainder will be the training dataset.</li>
<li>Then fit a linear model to the IV and DV in the training dataset.</li>
<li>Use the training linear model to predict the test DV, given its IV (<em>hint</em>: use the <code>predict()</code> function).</li>
<li>Now use your created <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> and RMSE functions to calculate these statistics, using observed test DV and predicted test DV (from the training model) as your two arguments.</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we have gone over the three main inferential goals in statistics: exploratory data analysis, confirmatory data analysis, and prediction. These three are mutually exclusive, and you only ever get to do <em>ONE</em> for a given research question and dataset. As you have seen in lecture and this tutorial, each one requires a different mindset and set of statistical techniques. As a result, knowing which statistical goal is right for your question effectively creates a road map for how you should conduct analyses and interpret, present, and write up results. For what it’s worth, I think 70% of my research has been exploratory, 20% confirmatory, and 10% prediction.</p>
Mastering these topics is part of the very important skill set of translating a research question into a statistical question. This is often the most difficult part of research, and as John Tukey said, “Finding the question is often more important than finding the answer.” Most papers I read (in paleoanthropology) conflate statistical goals, the most common being masquerading exploratory as confirmatory analyses. This is not done consciously or maliciously but most likely due to the fact that they never learned what the distinct statistical goals are and how they’re carried out. As a result though, I bet a lot of the findings in our field our false positives and not replicable. Be part of the positive change and clearly delineate these goals in your own research!
