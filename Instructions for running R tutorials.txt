INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESSING INTERACTIVE R TUTORIALS

1. Install R and RStudio.

2. Run these lines of code in your RStudio console:

install.packages("devtools", dep = TRUE)
install.packages("learnr", dep = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("andrewdu1/ANTH674")

2a. If the consoles ever disappear in the tutorial, exit and reopen RStudio, and then do a force reinstall of the package:

devtools::install_github("andrewdu1/ANTH674", force = TRUE)

3. To run a given week's tutorial:

learnr::run_tutorial("Week1", package = "ANTH674")

For Week 2's tutorial, you will type in "Week2" instead of "Week1". 
Same for Week 3's tutorial, and so on and so forth.
See the course syllabus for the topics covered each week.
